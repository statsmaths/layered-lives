Couch in 1939 from Chapel Hill. A respected editor turned part-time government bureaucrat, Couch served as director of both the University of North Carolina Press and the Southeast Regional Director of the Federal Writers’ Project (FWP).<sup className="tooltip"><span>Rubenstein DeMasi, Susan (2016). <em>Henry Alsberg: The Driving Force of the New Deal’s Federal Writer’s Project.</em> Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Co. pp. 200–202.</span><div>[1]</div></sup> As economic turmoil engulfed the nation, his concern for the region’s future mounted in tandem with elected leaders, government workers, and academics. Couch also joined cultural workers across the United States, such as writer James Agee and photographer Marion Post Wolcott. They shared a belief in the power of documentary expression to render visible silenced communities. However, with crucial interlocutors, including New Deal liberals in the FWP and sociologists, he troubled over how to "authentically" and "accurately" represent people and their conditions that were honest about the challenges of the region while challenging depictions of southern life as antiquated, depraved, and languid. "Somehow they must be given representation, somehow they must be given voice and allowed to speak, in their essential character," Couch argued.<sup className="tooltip"><span>William Terry Couch, ed., <em>These Are Our Lives</em> (University of North Carolina Press, 1939), x–xi.</span><div>[2]</div></sup></p> <p>The desire to circulate southern voices grew out of distress over how academic sociology and literature intellectuals portrayed the region. While the former risked reducing people to generalizations and nameless statistics further obscured by dense academic prose, the latter often depicted the region as backward through stereotypical characterizations, a theme that federal bureaucrats drew on to argue that the region could not modernize and move out of the Great Depression. The stakes heightened as intellectuals moved between the academy and New Deal state to identify and develop solutions. Couch proposed the Southern Life History Project (SLHP) as a special initiative in the FWP to address these issues. Government leaders such as Henry Alsberg, state FWP directors such as Edwin Bjorkman and William McDaniel, and federal writers such as Bernice Harris and Ida Moore worked with Couch to determine how best the initiative could document people’s life stories. Relying on the existing state and local FWP offices, the project employed over 150 federal writers and editors across the Southeast. This laudatory experiment in social documentary led to the collection of over 1,200 life histories in which Southerners shared their own stories of life during the Great Depression.</p> <p><em>Layered Lives: Rhetoric and Representation in the Southern Life History Project</em> recovers the history of the SLHP and their efforts to reconfigure the life history method. We employ an interdisciplinary approach that combines close readings of archival material with computational methods that analyze patterns across the collection. The digital platform gives readers an opportunity to explore archival materials and data alongside our argument, which opens up new forms of reading and interaction in the humanities. We address five questions: What were the motivating factors that led to the creation of the SLHP? How did the SLHP come into formation? How did the project come to define the form of a life history, and who was deemed capable of writing them? Which rhetorical strategies did SLHP writers employ to document interviewees’ lives, and how did these decisions shape who was and was not represented?</p> <p>What are the legacies of the SLHP? In addressing these questions, we demonstrate key points in the struggle over what counted as social knowledge, how to represent social conditions accurately, and who could produce such knowledge. Our digital platform is organized into layers that correspond to a critical question motivating our analysis.</p> <p>The organization of our text into layers reflects our methodology, which brings together the concept of rhetorical ecology with the spatial turn and computational text analysis in digital humanities. The rhetorical ecology approach emerged from rhetoric and composition studies to better understand how types of rhetoric, notably texts, were invented.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Marilyn M.

Rhetorical ecology places the collection of life histories within a complex ecosystem that includes SLHP administrators, writers, editors, and institutions, including the academic fields, higher education, and government agencies. To demonstrate the extent of this ecosystem, we turn to the digital humanities.<sup className="tooltip"><span>For example, see David J. Bodenhamer, John Corrigan, and Trevor M.

Along with revealing our interdisciplinary methodological approach, the use of layers instead of chapters or sections illustrates how the digital modality of our text shaped and was shaped by our methods and form of writing.</p> <p>The design and navigation of the site is an ecology as well. Readers will note that their screen is divided into two side-by-side portions. The left-hand side of the screen contains the Layers of our textual argument, and the right-hand side displays: Map Interface and Theme Interface. Readers can engage with this interlinking digital text in different ways. The Layers include links that will adjust the Map Interface and the Theme Interface to match a specific point in the textual argument.</p> <p>Additionally, the Layers contain links as well as figures that provide digital copies of clear archival evidence cited in the argument. One can select a layer either on the home page or on the menu on the top right of the interface. The default setting on the right side is Map Interface to convey the scope of the SLHP to the reader immediately. However, readers can explore the Theme Interface by selecting a button on the top left of the Map Interface. Within the Theme Interface, readers can explore the collection by topic models or document clustering. They serve as evidence for the argumentation in the Layers as well as an approach to access and discover the SLHP archive held at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill’s Southern Historical Collection. Connected and mutually reinforcing, our digital text places data, evidence, method, interpretation, and argument together through text, image, and interactive visualizations, demonstrating the ecology behind our writing and research.

As Director of UNC Press in Chapel Hill, Couch was immersed in ongoing debates at the time over how to document social conditions most accurately, including what gets counted as evidence, who are legitimate researchers, and how findings should be written. The field of sociology enjoyed prominence as a powerful intellectual arbiter in these debates during the 1920s and 1930s, when the social sciences were forging and institutionalizing their methodological toolkit. While certain parts of the discipline, such as the Columbia School, privileged quantitative data to develop generalized social truths, other parts such as the Chicago School and Chapel Hill School focused on qualitative data of individuals to study specific sociological features. Couch argued that both qualitative and quantitative approaches obscured the voices of the people by relying on faceless statistics or vague abstractions. Instead, he desired to create a new method of documentation that let the people speak for themselves.</p> <p><em><span onClick={() => props.handlePage(3)}>Layer 2</span>: The Formation of the SLHP</em> details how the project formed within the Federal Writers’ Project. As a New Deal agency, the FWP was part employment project and part laudatory experiment in federal support of cultural work.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jerrold Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America: A Cultural History of the Federal Writers’ Project</em> (Univ of North Carolina Press, 2004); Wendy Griswold and Wendy Griswold, <em>American Guides: The Federal Writers’ Project and the Casting of American Culture</em> (Chicago ; London: The University of Chicago Press, 2016); Jerre Mangione, <em>The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers’ Project, 1935-1943</em> (Syracuse University Press, 1996); Catherine A.

Odum’s Folklore Odyssey: Transformation to Tolerance Through African American Folk Studies</em> (University of Georgia Press, 2003); Rabinowitz, <em>They Must Be Represented: The Politics of Documentary</em>; Retman, <em>Real Folks</em>; Stewart, <em>Long Past Slavery</em>.</span><div>[6]</div></sup> To accomplish this project, Couch sent unemployed white-collar workers, hired as federal writers, across the Southeast region to interview fellow Southerners about their lives. The ability to hear from Southerners in their words, Couch argued, lent authority and authenticity to their claims about their conditions.</p> <p><em><span onClick={() => props.handlePage(4)}>Layer 3</span>: Defining Life Histories and Qualified Writers</em> turns to mapping the topology of the interlocutors that shaped the purpose and possibilities of the SLHP through visual and textual forms of argument. Writers, editors and administrators negotiated and forged a new method of social documentation that they believed could provide a mechanism to understand the challenges of the American South as articulated by those grappling with the effects of industrialization and systems of economic and racial inequality. The experiment led to the development of what Couch framed as a "new device" of documentary expression called a "life history," oral interviews of everyday people’s life experiences from their viewpoint captured in words by writers.</p> <p>Yet, the SLHP emerged among a crowded landscape of documentary projects in the FWP and beyond, which shaped who was and was <em>not</em> represented. They focused on what they labeled as the "typical" southerner, which they defined on the Black/White racial binary and by occupation. SLHP positioned southern laborers as perceptive about their conditions and shaped by the past and the present to disrupt stereotypes about the region as uneducated, lazy, and backward. In the process, the audience for the life histories comes into focus. By centering the hardships of the White working-class through first-person narrative stories that emphasized the emotional realities of the everyday experience, they became the voices of the South for middle- and upper-class White readers primarily residing on the east coast. These stories complicated problematic regional stereotypes but simultaneously erased the brutality of segregation and the effects of slavery by omitting stories that addressed such important issues, thereby reifying cultural and structural racism.</p> <p>The layer then turns to how assumptions about race, gender, expertise, and proximity shaped who could be a writer. Rather than seeking highly disciplined academics, SLHP administrators sought writers they believed could access the desired communities, listen, and effectively write the history recounted for a more general audience. White women writers dominated this process because of their positionality in southern society, shaped by gendered and racialized ideas that White women were better equipped to put interviewees at ease, record information, and access the domestic spaces in which the interviews occurred. The hiring practices constituted an opening for White women to hold a key position in gathering social knowledge. However, African American women and men were systematically denied such opportunities due to racist hiring practices that disqualified Black candidates and segregationist beliefs that African American and White writers could not work in the same office space.</p> <p><em>In <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(5)}>Layer 4</span>: Rhetorical Strategies and Representation</em>, we identify the rhetorical strategies used in the life histories that were developed to persuade the reader that they were hearing the person interviewed by using text analysis methods. Writers, editors, and administrators negotiated a form of the life history designed to reduce the presence of the writer and center the voice of the individual, yet with enough literary flourish to maintain their primary audience – White, affluent readers who enjoyed cultural, social, and political power in US society. Centering the interviewee’s voice also included using written dialect to help readers ‘hear’ while they read. However, our analysis reveals that such practices were used unevenly as written dialect dominated life histories of African Americans but was used more sparingly among White interviewees. Such stark differences demonstrate how a nearly all-white writing staff relied on Jim Crow sensibilities to create images of African American interviewees that conformed to the expectations of the White middle-class intended readership.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Enduring Legacies" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>The SLHP, together with other regional units of the FWP, produced nearly 10,000 interviews nationwide, constituting one of the nation’s largest first-person narrative collections.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Banks, Ann, Leonard Rapport, and Federal Writers’ Project, eds. <em>First-Person America</em>. 1st ed. New York: Knopf : distributed by Random House, 1980.</span><div>[7]</div></sup> However, over 80 years later, few have ever heard of the Southern Life History Project’s groundbreaking project or the significant effect on shaping ideas of what counted as social documentation, collective memory, and regional identity. For two brief years, the SLHP offered a different direction for social documentary. They attempted to reconfigure what counted as data and evidence about social conditions, believing that numbers and percentages could only tell part of the story. The richness of individual stories, as told from the interviewees’ point of view, offered another lens into society. They were "human" in a way that statistics could not capture. As we look today to numbers and big data as a privileged form of knowledge about our world, recovering the history of the SLHP offers an opportunity to analyze an earlier moment where there were animated debates about how and if numbers could help us understand each other during a time of great economic, cultural, and social turmoil. Looking back, we can see that our debates are not new but rather a part of a long history about <em>how</em> we know <em>what</em> we know and the role of data, statistics, and point-of-view in shaping how we understand pressing social issues.</p> <p>In aggregate, <em>Writing Their Voices</em> demonstrates an entangled story about: how the life histories, as a new form of documentary evidence concerned with capturing authenticity, contested existing approaches to producing sociological knowledge and public memory; the role that gender, class, and race played in negotiating these new methods; and, how this genre of social documentary helped to shape notions of what it meant to be an American and a Southerner during a time of political, social and economic unrest. While we address these themes, there are many exciting directions to understand these SLHP, which readers can see by moving through exploratory interfaces or by analyzing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3865765">Life Histories Data Set</a>. We invite readers to pose and answer questions of their own. We hope that by moving through this digital text, readers will see how our argument unfolds in new ways made possible by combining innovative methods with new affordances of the digital medium.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Situated Knowledges" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>As with the layers, rhetorical ecology also allows us to acknowledge and position ourselves. We bring together a range of theories, methods, and ways of knowing that shaped our training and areas of expertise. Courtney Rivard specializes in Rhetoric and Composition and explores the intersection of archival rhetorics and feminist studies. She is particularly interested in how digital protocols, such as categorization, indexing, and tagging practices, rhetorically shape notions of race, gender and national belonging in archives. Lauren Tilton is trained in documentary studies and draws on digital methods to produce evidence and convey scholarly arguments about US culture and society. Taylor Arnold is trained in the field of data science. His work applies and develops corpus-based techniques to study how messages are communicated through texts and visual media. Together, we engage with the digital humanities to bring together our ways of approaching scholarship, from applying computational models to text data to close reading in the physical archives to study the history, methods, and cultural work of the Southern Life Histories Collection. Because this project is trans-disciplinary, we delve further into how Rhetorical Studies, Documentary Studies, Data Science, and Digital Humanities shape this project.</p> <p>We begin with rhetorical studies, broadly conceived as "the study of producing discourses and interpreting how, when and why discourses are persuasive."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Keith and Lundberg, <em>The Essential Guide to Rhetoric</em>, 4.</span><div>[8]</div></sup> Rhetoric is often figured in popular culture in a negative light as if it is not ‘real’ and ‘authentic,’ but only about persuading or convincing someone of something by any means possible. However, as Kenneth Burke, one of the most prominent rhetorical scholars of the 20th century, who not by coincidence lived and wrote during the same period of concern in our study, argues, "wherever there is persuasion, there is rhetoric.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Burke, <em>A Rhetoric of Motives</em>, 172.</span><div>[9]</div></sup> And wherever there is ‘meaning,’ there is ‘persuasion.’" For Burke rhetoric is the study of how meaning is produced, which necessarily requires persuasion; therefore, rhetoric is constitutive of producing the very notion of what is authentic.</p> <p>Rhetorical studies offer a number of theories to understand how meaning is produced through written texts, performance, speeches, art, images, or any type of communication. These theories involve close analysis of how a rhetor (the agent of the rhetoric) produces rhetoric. For example, how does a rhetor establish their credibility or ethos? How does a rhetor constitute, invent, and frame the audience they aim to persuade? What is the situation or exigence that led to the creation of the rhetoric and the constraints that frame what is possible? How does the modality (digital, oratory, bodily, etc.) affect the rhetoric? These same questions that help to analyze how rhetoric is produced can also be used to craft rhetoric more effectively, which is why many scholars emphasize composition along with rhetoric.</p> <p>While theories that focus on the rhetor, the audience, and the text are important, they cannot be analyzed in isolation because they each play a part in producing rhetoric, often in dynamic and systematic ways. For this reason, the theory of rhetorical ecology emerged in the 1980s to attend to how rhetoric was the result of "dynamic interlocking systems which structure the social activity of writing."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Cooper, "The Ecology of Writing," 368.</span><div>[10]</div></sup> We draw on this theory of rhetorical ecology to demonstrate the systems involved in producing the genre of life histories. As we show, life histories were the result of complex historical conditions, competition between different projects, conflicting ideologies held by different administrators, conceptions of an American audience, interpretive decisions by individual writers, perceptions of and by interviewees, and structures of power inherently linked to notions of race, gender, and class. Rhetorical ecology helps us attend to the impact of these interlocking systems on the production of life histories.</p> <p>With the theory of rhetorical ecology, we also draw on feminist rhetorical historiography in our methodological approach. Gaining prominence in the 1990s, feminist rhetorical historiography emerged as a response to absences and silences within the subfield of the history of rhetorics. History of rhetorics is concerned both with the historical emergence of the study of rhetoric and applying rhetorical theory to historiographic methods. However, these histories and methods all too often reinscribe histories and power relations that center White, male agents of rhetoric by privileging particular kinds of evidence. Many scholars questioned these approaches, resulting in a "critical shift from historical subjects to historical production itself."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Charles E. Morris III and K. J. Rawson, "Queer Archives/Archival Queers," <em>Theorizing Histories of Rhetoric</em>, 2013, 74.</span><div>[11]</div></sup> This shift brought attention to archival methods and archival structures, leading to studies concerned with analyzing how archives could not be understood "as a passive receptacle[s] for historical documents and their ‘truths,’ or a benign research space[s], but rather as a dynamic site[s] of rhetorical power."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Charles E. Morris, "The Archival Turn in Rhetorical Studies; Or, the Archive’s Rhetorical (Re) Turn," <em>Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs</em> 9, no. 1 (2006): 115.</span><div>[12]</div></sup></p> <p>Central to these studies were feminist rhetoricians concerned with developing new methods to recover voices that have been historically silenced.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ballif, <em>Theorizing Histories of Rhetoric</em>; Royster and Kirsch, <em>Feminist Rhetorical Practices</em>.</span><div>[13]</div></sup> Among these scholars is K.J. Rawson who has argued for methods that work to "queer the archive" by destablizing "normative archival practices."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Rawson, "The Rhetorical Power of Archival Description."</span><div>[14]</div></sup> Digital methods are often heralded as having such destabilizing possibilities. However, Graban cautions that digital methods must go beyond mere digitization to avoid digitizing "analogue desires" that "remain stuck in a notion of recovery that privileges cumulative advantage" at the expense of more complex histories.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Graban, "Ripple Effects," 107.</span><div>[15]</div></sup> She argues that combining archival metadata and data visualization with a critical feminist rhetorical perspective can offer alternatives to mere recovery work.</p> <p><em>Writing Their Voices</em> takes up this call to use digital methods to visualize archival metadata alongside close readings of archival material and computational text analysis. These visualizations offer new ways of seeing the SLHP archive that focus on how the intersections of race, gender, and class inform the emergence of the project and the composition of life histories. In so doing, our metadata visualizations reveal that White women were the most prolific writers in the project, recovering a history that has never been discussed before. However, their roles and relationship to the interviewees that they wrote about were complicated by power structures that they both resisted and perpetuated. Through close reading and computational text analysis, such complications come into view. White women were able to write the vast majority of life histories by using gendered assumptions about their ‘natural’ ability as sympathetic listeners and accurate recorders of information to their advantage, while simultaneously supporting principles of whiteness that diminished the abilities of Black writers and presented a notion of Southern identity as following along a "color line" in which interviewees who were defined by their gaze as neither Black or White were not given much attention in the project.</p> <p>Next, we situate this project within Documentary Studies. A prominent area of concern is how documentary production shapes cultural, political, and social belonging in the United States. Specifically, scholars have demonstrated how documentary work is a tool of power.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Grace Elizabeth Hale, <em>Making Whiteness: The Culture of Segregation in the South, 1890-1940</em> (Vintage, 2010); Scott L. Matthews, <em>Capturing the South: Imagining America’s Most Documented Region</em> (UNC Press Books, 2018); Laura Wexler, <em>Tender Violence: Domestic Visions in an Age of US Imperialism</em> (UNC Press Books, 2000).</span><div>[16]</div></sup> Part of this power is produced through documentary claims to truth telling and capturing reality, theorized by medium such as film and photography by scholars including Bill Nichols and William Stott. As part of this work, scholars have identified the 1930s as the era that documentary emerged as a genre for representing social life and therefore a new and powerful category for cultural production. Scholars such as Jonathan Kahana, Paula Rabinowitz, and Trinh Minh-Ha have focused on the politics of representation, asking us to consider who is chosen as the subject of documentary and why, how they are represented, and who controls this documentary work.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Trinh T. Minh-Ha, "The Totalizing Quest of Meaning," <em>Theorizing Documentary</em> 1 (1993): 90–107; Jonathan Kahana, <em>Intelligence Work: The Politics of American Documentary</em> (Columbia University Press, 2008); Paula Rabinowitz, <em>They Must Be Represented: The Politics of Documentary</em>(Verso, 1994).</span><div>[17]</div></sup> These questions are central to <em>Writing Their Voices</em> and inform our analysis of the entangled relationship between medium, scope, representation, and power that shaped the SLHP.</p> <p>At the same time, our work is part of a recent turn to consider how a narrow definition of documentary may be limiting how we understand the cultural and social work of documentary. This shift has been led by Sonnet Retman who argues that to understand the impact of documentary expression in the 1930s, we must consider how cultural expression does not often neatly fit into a single genre.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Sonnet H. Retman, <em>Real Folks: Race and Genre in the Great Depression</em> (Duke University Press, 2011).</span><div>[18]</div></sup> Drawing on the work of Wai Chee Dimock, she states that two, hybrid genres developed during the era that challenged documentary’s claim to the real and authentic and offered a space for critique of the "folk," an idea that was being used to define who was and was not an "authentic" member of the nation. Our work is a part of this shift to reassess the contours of documentary and the 1930s.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Wai-Chee Dimock, <em>Through Other Continents: American Literature across Deep Time</em> (Princeton University Press, 2006).</span><div>[19]</div></sup> Jerrold Hirsch’s <em>Portrait of America</em> is one of the only pieces of scholarship to study the SLHP as a unique initiative within the FWP. The book celebrated the SLHP by situating it within a story of American pluralism. On the other hand, our work challenges this framing by comparing and contrasting how the project configured its goals in contestation rather than complementing other FWP projects and the larger ecosystem of social documentary. We also build off of Catherine Stewart’s analysis of the Ex-slave Narrative Project in <em>Long Past Slavery</em> that examines the writing process of the narratives to look more closely at the understudied Southern Life History Program. Like Stewart who illuminates the agents in the creation of the ex-slave narratives, we also focus on the writing process of the life histories, but do so by centering rhetorical theory and documentary studies to look at how debates over documentary methods led to the life histories program.</p> <p><em>Writing Their Voices</em> expands the debate about documentary work in the era. Rather than understanding the Southern Life History Program, and the larger Federal Writers’ Projects documentary projects, as a drive toward romantic nationalism and cultural pluralism, as historian Jerold Hirsch has argued, we focus on the debates, particularly over method, that caused FWP projects to define their scope along geographical, racialized, and gendered lines.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 3.</span><div>[20]</div></sup> We track how efforts to document Americans through life histories became a site of active negotiation between three ways of representing social life—anthropology, folklore, and sociology - to forge a different kind of documentary work. Focused on the present rather than the past, lived experiences instead of folk tales, and qualitative over quantitative evidence, the writers listened to people describe their circumstances and then wrote their life histories. Building on research on the debates over social science knowledge, our project also historicizes arguments about the relationship between qualitative and qualitative research and the <em>kind</em> of data necessary to understand people’s lives.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Dorothy Ross, <em>The Origins of American Social Science</em>, vol. 19 (Cambridge University Press, 1992); Mark C Smith, <em>Social Science in the Crucible: The American Debate over Objectivity and Purpose, 1918-1941</em> (Duke University Press, 1994); Alice O’Connor, <em>Poverty Knowledge: Social Science, Social Policy, and the Poor in Twentieth-Century US History</em>, vol. 59 (Princeton University Press, 2009).</span><div>[21]</div></sup> This shows how different interviewers deployed different practices and how their practices impacted how Americans were documented. Since the FWP was about documenting America, it also became a site that determined who counted as a part of the nation. Looking closely at how people were represented reveals how communities were included or excluded.</p> <p>The field of Data Science also shaped our exploration of the rhetorical work of the SLHP. While identified as an independent field of research only within the past decade, core foundational ideas of Data Science were first formulated in the 1960s and 1970s by John Tukey. In his seminal work <em>Exploratory Data Analysis</em>, Tukey stressed the need to "[look] at data to see what it seems to say."<sup className="tooltip"><span>John Tukey, <em>Exploratory Data Analysis (</em>Addison-Wesley, 1977<em>).</em></span><div>[22]</div></sup> He argued that identifying new insights from data requires the use of data visualization techniques and a move away from emphases on models grounded in mathematical formalisms. Extending Tukey’s call to formulate hypotheses through graphical methods, scholarship by, amongst others, Jacques Bertin, Leland Wilkinson, William Cleveland, Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu have argued that data visualizations can stand on their own as forms of knowledge creation and argumentation.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jacques Bertin, <em>Sémiologie Graphique. Les diagrammes, les réseaux, les cartes</em> (Gauthier-Villars, 1967); Leland Wilkinson, <em>The Grammar of Graphics</em> (Springer, 1999); William Cleveland, <em>Visualizing Data</em> (Hobart Press, 1993); Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu, <em>Data Sketches: A journey of imagination, exploration, and beautiful data visualizations</em> (CRC Press, 2021).</span><div>[23]</div></sup> These ideas permeate the data analysis in our project, which centers graphical displays overlaid on a map and relatively simple tables and summary statistics.</p> <p>Critical to data science is attention to <em>how</em> data is created and how this shapes which questions and areas of inquiry one can and cannot pursue. Central to our approach has been D’Iganzio and Klein’s call for data science to approach this work through the lens of data feminism, which thinks critically about the role of power, data, and categorization. We pair their approach with Jessica Marie Johnson’s call to pay attention to the history of quantification, specifically cautions about the enumeration of Black life.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Caterine D’Iganzio and Lauren Klein, <em>Data Feminsism</em>, (The MIT Press, 2020); Jessica Marie Johnson, "Markup BodiesBlack [Life] Studies and Slavery [Death] Studies at the Digital Crossroads," <em>Social Text</em> 36, no. 4 (137) (2018): 57–79;</span><div>[24]</div></sup> In the <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(7)}>Methods</span>, we delve further into data construction.

Our approach blends more traditional text analysis methods (i.e. topic modeling) with methods that are less common in digital humanities scholarship (i.e. document clustering), and demonstrates how expanding our computational approaches can facilitate Rhetorical Studies and Documentary Studies.</p> <p>Finally, the project is positioned within the digital humanities (DH). As an area that brings computational methods to bear on the humanities, DH shapes the methods, evidence, and form of scholarly communication. Turning primary sources into "humanities data" has been met with resistance, and, as Miriam Posner has stated, been "a necessary contradiction."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Miriam Posner, "Humanities Data: A Necessary Contradiction." Harvard Purdue Data Management. June 17, 2015. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/">[link]</a></span><div>[30]</div></sup> Debates have ensued over whether computational methods can even produce the evidence necessary for humanities scholarship, with one of the most recent flashpoints being the dismissal of such methods by Nan Z. Da in <em>Critical Inquiry</em>.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Nan Z. Da, "The Computational Case against Computational Literary Studies," Critical Inquiry 45, no. 3 (2019): 601–39.</span><div>[31]</div></sup> We see our work as moving beyond this tired debate about if computational methods can be evidence to questions about <em>which</em> methods and <em>what kinds</em> of evidence they produce. While "distant reading" approaches in digital humanities have been applied to many literary works, there is relatively minimal comparative analysis on archival sources and oral histories. Key to figuring out which methods are appropriate for which kind of primary sources is working with experts in computational methods. As Arnold and Tilton have argued in the <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities</em> series, statistics is central to DH and why we wanted to not only draw on statistical methods but model how a trained statistician is central to DH scholarship.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Arnold and Tilton, "New Data? The Role of Statistics in DH", <em>Debates in the Digital Humanities 2019</em></span><div>[32]</div></sup> We not only hope that this project demonstrates how collaboration across divisions such as "humanities", "science", and "social science" can lead to new scholarship, but also how the "technical" expert is central to this kind of work and should be credited accordingly, as a co-author.</p> <p>We also draw on a long legacy of projects in the digital humanities that have made use of digital forms to convey scholarly knowledge such as early examples like University of Virginia’s <em>Valley of the Shadow</em> to contemporary examples like University of Richmond’s <em>Renewing Inequality.</em> Where this project departs is the combination of substantial textual argumentation with archival evidence and interactive data visualizations. Rather than toggling between different pages, the project offers a clear, explicit textual interpretation with embedded images of the archival source alongside the computational interpretation of the data through a text analysis visualizer and an interactive map. The text, primary sources, and computational evidence is literally on the same screen. In so doing, we are also modeling a shift called for by the subfield of Digital History. In the co-authored "Digital History and Argument", over 25 scholars identified new approaches to historical argumentation made possible by digital forms and called for their recognition by the field.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Lincoln Mullen, Stephen Robertson, et al. "Digital History and Argumentation." White Paper. 2017. Available online at: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://rrchnm.org/argument-white-paper/">[link]</a></span><div>[33]</div></sup> Our project offers a blend of more traditional argumentation (i.e. text) with newer forms (i.e. interactive visualizations such as graphs and maps) in order to model how multiple forms of argumentation further scholarship. Moreover, we show how scholarship can make arguments (i.e. the layer) while leaving space for readers to explore the data and ask new questions (i.e. the interactive map and open access data).</p> <p>Finally, we turn to our positionalities. As scholars trained and steeped in these respective fields, we brought together our areas of expertise to collaborate and co-create across disciplinary boundaries. This project has not always been easy. Three authors with substantially different training working together to refine the project and find a shared voice was a challenging task. Peer reviewers offered generous, supportive, and pointed feedback pushing us to weave our voices together into a single theoretical framework that was made stronger by the multiple strands of scholarship from documentary studies, rhetoric and composition, data science, and the digital humanities. We have worked to realize their feedback, even amid a global pandemic. There are inevitably analytical possibilities that we, as White scholars situated in the United States, have not explored that those with other kinds of training as well as affective, locational, and embodied ways of knowing would bring to such a project. All data is open access. All code is open source. We look forward to future scholarship that continues to push the boundaries of interdisciplinary, collaborative digital scholarship.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Acknowledgements" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>As a part of an American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS) Digital Extension Grant, we partnered in 2015 to begin exploring how digital humanities methods could open up new questions about the Federal Writers Project’s SLHP. The ACLS allowed for the creation of the SLHP data set and launched this project. A number of student workers helped in this process of data collection including Emeline Blevins Alexander, Bal Artis, Carla Aviles, Karissa Barrera, Elizabeth Bonesteel, Kayley Bryson, Ivana Devine, Grant Glass, Grace Hilebrand, Sarah Moody, Lacie Morrison, Scott Robinson, and Sara Siemens.<sup className="tooltip"><span>All students either received course credit or were financially compensated for their time. For more about our commitment to ethical labor practices, see Courtney Rivard, Taylor Arnold, and Lauren Tilton, "Building Pedagogy into Project Development: Making Data Construction Visible in Digital Projects," <em>Digital Humanities Quarterly</em> 013, no. 2 (August 1, 2019).</span><div>[34]</div></sup></p> <p>Telling the story of the SLHP also involved significant archival research. We want to thank the Southern Historical Collection at UNC-Chapel Hill for their support and the opportunity to immerse ourselves in the archive. The library’s commitment to digitization and open access made this project possible. We particularly want to thank Matthew Turi, Jason Tomberlin, and Matt Jenson for sharing their time and expertise. A Wilson Library Visiting Research Fellowship, an NEH-Mellon Fellowship for Digital Publication Fellowship, the Tyson/Belk Faculty Fellowship from the Institute of Arts &amp; Humanities at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the University of Richmond’s pre-tenure leave policy provided the time and financial support to work collaboratively in Chapel Hill and over zoom, particularly amid a global pandemic.</p> <p>No project is written solely by the authors. Generous feedback from colleagues enriched this work. Thank you to Tilton’s writing circle colleagues at the University of Richmond including Janette Amaral-Rodriguez, Dieter Gunkel, Atiya Husain, Camilla Nonterah, Agnieska Szymanska, and Caroline Weist for reading early drafts. Great appreciation is extended to Rivard’s IAH faculty fellows: Tim Marr, Katherine Turk, Oswaldo Estrada, Priscilla Wald, Florence Babb, Maya Berry, Serenella Iovino, Townsend Middleton, and Claudia Yaghoobi. We are also indebted to the significant time and care of the external reviewers. We are deeply appreciative of their support and the time that they carved out to provide invaluable feedback during a pandemic.</p> <p>A project like this is only possible thanks to the freedom to experiment with new methods and to explore new modes of scholarly communication. Thank you to Stanford University Press and our editor Friederike Sundaram for developing a new and innovative avenue for scholarship. We are excited to be a part of this journey. Thank you to our colleagues at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, specifically the Department of English &amp; Comparative Literature, and the University of Richmond, specifically the Department of Math &amp; Statistics and Department of Rhetoric &amp; Communication, for helping us advocate through institutional structures that these new kinds and forms of interdisciplinary research should not only count but are key to the innovative scholarship that our institution’s state is central to their mission.</p> <p>Finally, thank you to our families. Courtney Rivard extends her heartfelt gratitude to her partner, Thomas, and two children, Robby and Lexi. They provided her with the encouragement, love, and countless cups of tea needed to complete this project, no small feat considering most of the writing occurred during the pandemic in which everyone was home together.</p> </Collapsible> </div>
