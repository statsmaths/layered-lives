In most cases, the challenges were not new. Issues such as exploitative agricultural economies, industrialization, and unemployment were exacerbated but not new features of American society. The need to understand and alleviate these social issues took on new urgency with the Great Depression, a problem the Roosevelt Administration hoped to solve through the New Deal.</p> <p>Against this backdrop emerged the Federal Writers’ Project (FWP). This New Deal agency pursued documentary projects as part employment and laudatory experiment in federal support of cultural work. They entered the fore over how to document and communicate people’s "real" conditions in the U.S.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jerrold Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America: A Cultural History of the Federal Writers’ Project</em> (Univ of North Carolina Press, 2004); Wendy Griswold and Wendy Griswold, <em>American Guides: The Federal Writers’ Project and the Casting of American Culture</em> (Chicago ; London: The University of Chicago Press, 2016); Jerre Mangione, <em>The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers’ Project, 1935-1943</em> (Syracuse University Press, 1996); Catherine A.

The ability to hear from Southerners in their words, Couch argued, lent authority and authenticity to their claims about their conditions. Since garnering university support was a tall task, in part due to Odum’s skepticism about the project, Couch utilized his position in the FWP to launch the life histories project. By engaging in questions about how best to capture, document, and analyze social conditions, Couch, UNC, and the New Deal would shape what counted as sociological knowledge and the role of public institutions in the process.<sup className="tooltip"><span>There is a significant amount of research on the New Deal State; work includes Brent Cebul, Lily Geismer, and Mason B.

Along with reforms such as moving the United States dollar off the gold standard, the government began to regulate securities at the federal level and require disclosures that helped assess the health of the banks, such as gains and losses. Relief was significantly directed at agriculture and providing aid to farmers. The Farm Security Administration paid farmers to put away their plows to raise agriculture prices. At the same time, infrastructure projects like the Rural Electrification Administration and Tennessee Valley Authority were designed to modernize rural life and create jobs. Developing further relief programs, the Second New Deal (1935-1936) focused on American workers - creating jobs, providing social security, and improving labor relations. The federal government served as the nation’s largest employer, hiring in sectors as disparate as highway construction and theater performance. The Works Progress Administration (WPA), founded in May 1935, led the way by employing millions of mostly White Americans to labor on public works. As such, the federal government demonstrated the nation’s strength as it led the recovery.</p> <p>While the WPA is often most remembered for its public works such as roads and dams, White-collar workers were also in need of work, especially writers, artists, and other cultural workers who began advocating for relief, including the creation of unions.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Michael Denning, <em>The Cultural Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century</em> (Verso, 1998).</span><div>[6]</div></sup> For example, the Author’s League, established in 1917, joined forces with the Unemployed Writers’ Association (UWA), a new organization founded in January 1934 in response to the depression, to lobby Congress to develop a national plan to employ writers. Frustrated by what they saw as partial gains, a subset of members of the UWA became the Writers’ Union.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Penkower, <em>The Federal Writers’ Project ; a Study in Government Patronage of the Arts</em>, 15.</span><div>[7]</div></sup> Other writers picketed in the streets to be included in the WPA.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Penkower, 1–2.</span><div>[8]</div></sup> To what degree such unions directly impacted government policies remains an open question. Still, there is no denying that organizing helped bring attention to the plight of cultural workers.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Penkower, 15–16.</span><div>[9]</div></sup></p> <p>At the same time, there were bureaucrats who valued cultural workers’ labor; some argued that all types of workers deserved access to federal resources, while others recognized the cultural power of harnessing cultural work. Franklin Roosevelt, for example, supported such efforts because artists needed to live, too.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Penkower, 10.</span><div>[10]</div></sup> Others argued that writers were able to highlight and therefore celebrate American life during a crisis of confidence in the nation.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>.</span><div>[11]</div></sup> Whether driven by providing equal opportunity for employment or using art to celebrate national pride, bureaucrats came together to support employing cultural workers.</p> <p><strong>The Founding of the WPA</strong></p> <p>Among these savvy and empathetic bureaucrats who recognized cultural workers as deserving support was one of Roosevelt’s trusted New Deal leaders, Harry Hopkins, head of the Federal Emergency Relief Act (FERA) from 1933 to 1935. His philosophy toward economic relief was to match the skills of those on relief with work opportunities that fit their skill sets, so he ordered surveys to assess the occupations of relief recipients. Among the ranks were white-collar workers, including writers and artists, who were left out of the state-run relief programs that equated work with manual labor.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Penkower, <em>The Federal Writers’ Project: A Study in Government Patronage of the Arts</em>, 9–10.</span><div>[12]</div></sup> An artist laying piling for a building was as a mismatch as a construction worker painting a mural in a city hall. Rather, he reasoned, employment opportunities should reflect the occupations of those on relief. He scoured his network to find successful models for national-level cultural worker programs.</p> <p>Conditions changed in August 1934 when Hopkin’s former college classmate, Hugh Harlan, became the Newspapers Writers’ Project for Los Angeles County. Professional writers were hired to write histories, conduct sociological studies, and craft reports. Over half of the writers left for full-time employment, considered a resounding success. FERA leaders Jake Baker and Arthur "Tex" Goldschmidt used the program’s success as well as ideas from advocacy groups, such as the Writers’ Union, to outline potential national programs within FERA that included commissioning projects for public institutions, hiring Black writers, interviewing ex-slaves in Ohio, and documenting America’s folklore, which was understood to be vanishing.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Penkower, 16-17.</span><div>[13]</div></sup></p> <p>When Baker asked Henry Alsberg to join FERA in mid-1934 as supervisor of reports and records, he, too, liked the idea of a writer’s project.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Penkower, 20.</span><div>[14]</div></sup> Alsberg had matriculated through elite schools in New York City, including Columbia, which he entered at 15 years old and stayed for law school. Alsberg was among many Columbia graduates who entered the ranks of New Deal leadership, but his path was not a clear one into government service. After deciding that neither law nor academia was for him, he became a foreign correspondent and returned stateside to New York City. A writer and supporter of theater, he circulated in leftist circles and counted among his friends Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, and Issac Don Levine. While accounts of Alsberg’s manner suggest his personality was more bohemian than bureaucratic, he enjoyed great respect from colleagues who had ascended into powerful roles within the New Deal state.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Penkower, 18-20.</span><div>[15]</div></sup> Once he joined FERA, he was able to shape policy and direct resources, which he did by focusing his attention on how the government could support cultural workers, particularly writers. He would soon count Couch among his colleagues and confidants and lend his support to collecting the Southern Life Histories Project.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="The WPA Sets-Up Federal #1" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>In 1935, FERA was replaced with two new federal agencies — the Works Progress Administration (WPA) and the Social Security Administration. Hopkins was tapped to lead the WPA in 1935 and brought with him his care for cultural workers; such a commitment was important because the WPA had appropriated over 4.8 billion dollars ($90 billion in 2019): 6.7 percent of the nation’s GDP.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jason Scott Smith, <em>Building New Deal Liberalism: The Political Economy of Public Works, 1933-1956</em> (Cambridge University Press, 2006), 87.</span><div>[16]</div></sup> WPA focused on employment, which marked a shift in New Deal policy from funding relief rolls to providing steady jobs with wages established by the government. Like FERA, the focus was on public works, particularly infrastructure such as buildings and roads. However, with Hopkins at the helm, the WPA quickly sought to add programs for white-collar workers and procured hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for these efforts. The monies were sent to the WPA over other agencies, such as Public Works Administration, due to the creation of Federal Project Number One (Federal #1).</p> <p>Under the Works Progress Administration, Federal #1 employed over 40,000 creatives in art, music, acting, and writing under five projects: Federal Art Project, Federal Music Project, Federal Theatre Project, Federal Writers’ Project (FWP), and the Historical Records Survey. The Historical Records Survey began as a part of the FWP but became a separate project in 1939 as the FWP came under increased scrutiny. While a small percentage of WPA employees, only 40,000 of the 8.5 million who worked for the WPA, the cultural impact of Federal #1 was anything but insignificant.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Deborah Mutnick, "Toward a Twenty-First-Century Federal Writers’ Project," <em>College English</em> 77, no. 2 (2014): 124–45.</span><div>[17]</div></sup> Scholars agree that the effort was among the largest and most influential government-led and administered efforts to support and shape cultural production in the United States.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Christine Bold, <em>The WPA Guides: Mapping America</em> (Univ.

Labeled by scholars as the "documentary decade," the 1930s was when cultural workers experimented with documentary representation.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Cara A.

Questions abounded about how to understand and communicate the effects of the Great Depression. In areas such as mass media and the federal government, cultural workers looked for methods to make visible and authentically represent contemporary conditions. The need to communicate the toll of the depression led to documentary expression in forms such as film, photography, performance, and writing. One prominent area was the literary market. The publishing industry enjoyed the success of documentary books like <em>You Have Seen Their Faces</em> by Erskine Caldwell and Margaret Bourke-White.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Erskine Caldwell, Margaret Bourke-White, and Alan Trachtenberg, <em>You Have Seen Their Faces</em> (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1995).</span><div>[23]</div></sup> However, it was not only the belief in documentary’s ability to assess and render visible the effects of the Great Depression that elevated its status, but also its privileged position for rendering truthful depictions of actuality that could "authentically" document daily life. The Southern Life History Project would draw on the cultural power of documentary in the 1930s.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="The Power of Social Documentary" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>"Social documentary," in particular, caught the imagination of Americans, making it a prominent genre and cultural form that enjoyed legitimacy and authority. While exact definitions of social documentary remain an open debate, the concept in the 1930s meant work that focused on documenting social conditions.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Rabinowitz, <em>They Must Be Represented: The Politics of Documentary</em>; Maren Stange, <em>Symbols of Ideal Life: Social Documentary Photography in America, 1890-1950</em> (Cambridge University Press, 1989); Stott, <em>Documentary Expression and Thirties America</em>.</span><div>[24]</div></sup> This idea was shaped by over forty years of social documentary photography best known through the work of people like Jacob Riis and Lewis Hine, known for images of New York City tenements and of child labor in factories, respectively. Moreover, cultural workers believed that emphasizing the everyday hardships that Americans experienced during the Great Depression as authentic and true had the power to reveal the roots of the social problems that caused these harsh conditions. Such an approach could affect meaningful and significant social change.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Stott, <em>Documentary Expression and Thirties America</em>.</span><div>[25]</div></sup> Couch shared these commitments by positioning life histories as a form that could document the challenges of life in the South directly through the voices of those impacted, with the added benefit of helping policymakers and scholars identify necessary reforms. The federal government’s embrace of documentary allowed for this configuration of life histories to flourish.</p> <p>The belief in the power of social documentary strongly impacted New Deal agencies, which embraced the documentary impulse. Photographers were employed in departments such as the Civilian Conservation Corps and National Youth Administration.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Pete Daniel et al., <em>Official Images : New Deal Photography</em> (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1987).</span><div>[26]</div></sup> The Farm Security Administration’s Historic Division, for example, was initially charged with documenting the need for and success of New Deal relief services as a project; it collected hundreds of thousands of photographs and became one of the most famous documentary photography projects of the 20th century.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Gilles Mora and Beverly W.

The project’s main goal was to employ white-collar workers such as historians, librarians, and writers to produce cultural products, including tourist guide books, often with a focus on the unique traits of the nation.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Mangione, <em>The Dream and the Deal</em>, 47.</span><div>[29]</div></sup> Project directors understood that they were able to shape ideas about American culture and belonging, so they set out to create a national culture that embraced pluralism.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Bold, <em>The WPA Guides</em>, xiv.</span><div>[30]</div></sup> Writers documented everyday life across the nation and included some of the most prominent authors of the 20th century, such as Ralph Ellison, Zora Neal Hurston, and Studs Terkel. While the FWP was under constant scrutiny from conservatives, the project garnered praise from cultural influencers. As one writer for the <em>New Republic</em> wrote, within the New Deal programs, the FWP may be "‘the most influential and valuable of them all.’"<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jeutonne P.

The nexus of its struggles was with the American Guide Series, which became the raison d’être of the agency and one of its most famous projects. Premised on the mobility provided by newly affordable automobiles and the success of guidebooks in Europe, FWP administrators reasoned that carefully researched and written guides could inspire Americans to "See America" by enticing them to explore the interesting stories and beautiful vistas that were in their own backyard.<sup className="tooltip"><span>The most notable guidebook was the Baedeker Guides, which became popular as trains and then automobiles made travel into an exciting adventure that was accessible to wider audiences. Though not often credited, the idea for the American Guidebooks was largely the result of Katherine Kellock, who would become a key member of the WPA staff. See Bold, <em>The WPA Guides</em> and Penkower, <em>The Federal Writers’ Project ; A Study in Government Patronage of the Arts</em>.</span><div>[32]</div></sup> For a nation fractured by the failures of the Great Depression, the Guidebooks became a site to celebrate the state and regional differences that made up America. Each book comprised a part of a symbolic national library, which collectively provided a portrait of a nation.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>.</span><div>[33]</div></sup> Such guides were intended to celebrate a new pluralistic vision of America while helping the economy recover through consumerism.</p> <figure><img src='img/figure2-2.png' alt='figure' onClick={() => props.handleImage(7)}/><figcaption><b>Figure 7.</b> A booth at the Ohio State Fair in 1937 exhibiting the work of the Ohio FWP.

The FWP administration believed that the magnitude of research needed to complete the Guidebooks required a tiered approach. City offices were created to research local history and culture, state bureaus coordinated the local efforts and served as editors, and the central headquarters in Washington, D.C. oversaw the whole project. While state directors could suggest projects, all initiatives and goals had to be approved by the administrators in the nation’s capital. This multi-tiered structure grew quickly, employing over 6,000 people within the first year. However, the system also created tension among the different stakeholders at each level who often disagreed over who was best fit to determine what constituted local culture and how to represent it: an institutional challenge the SLHP would have to navigate.</p> <p>It was in these conflicts over authentic culture and representation that the intended audience of the Guidebooks became clear: middle and upper class, White Americans who had the funds to travel to "see America." The suggested tours and discussion of local cultures in the Guidebooks often used stories of "local color" to exoticize immigrants and African Americans, as well as erasing how people of color could (and could not) travel through these American routes - a testament to the culture of segregation of the era. The Negro Motorist Green Book, created in 1936 by Victor H. Green &amp; Company, brings the racialized lens and audience in stark relief.</p> <p>African Americans used these "Green Books" not as a celebration of American pluralism but as savvy strategies to navigate violent terrains of whiteness to move safely throughout the United States.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Michael W.

There is no denying that celebrating diversity became a part of the portrait of America created in the Guidebooks as other scholars such as Alfred Kazin, Jerry Maginone, and Christine Bold have argued. However, the SLHP complicates the extent of Hirsch’s claim. FWP officials from the top such as Alsberg to state-level writers such as Leonard Rapport knew the life histories would reveal tensions in the region that could not be eased simply by celebrating cultural diversity. These tensions become clear in the subsequent layers through the distant reading of the entire life history collection.</span><div>[36]</div></sup></p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Launching the SLHP" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>The opportunity to create the SLHP came during the reorganization of state bureaus under regional offices in 1937. The FWP sought to streamline the reporting hierarchy to expedite the completion of the Guidebooks and to reduce the ever-growing number of conflicts between state-level workers and D.C. FWP officials were particularly keen on speeding up the process to get the Guidebooks to print as there was growing discontent by many politicians over the costs of such New Deal projects. It was in this reshuffling that Henry Alsberg brought Couch into the project.</p> <p>Couch’s editorial prowess and vast network of acclaimed writers and scholars quickly gained him recognition from D.C., especially from Alsberg. Because of his far-reaching knowledge of the Tar Heel state’s culture and history as Director of UNC Press, Couch was called on to consult on North Carolina-focused projects, ultimately leading to his position as the Associate Director of the N.C. Writers Project. With the reorganization of the FWP, Couch moved into a central leadership position as the Regional Director of the Southeast states, including Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, at the bequest of Alsberg.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Letter from Harry L. Hopkins to William Couch, May 24, 1938. Folder 1084 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Digital image: 0898.</span><div>[37]</div></sup> With one foot in the federal government and one foot in academia, as the director of the South’s most prominent press, Couch was in a position to pursue a new approach to documenting social lives. His approach helped to move the Southeast region of the FWP away from the American Guidebooks, which used the genre of travel guides to create authorial expertise about place and culture, to what he saw as a new literary genre. He would come to call this genre "life histories" as they relied on Southerners’ own stories about their lives to portray ideas about the culture of the South.</p> <p>While Couch shepherded the Guidebooks with great care in his new role, his passion was identifying and solving the problems of the American South, which was not the goal of Guidebooks that aimed to celebrate and entice readers to celebrate America through leisure and consumerism. Instead, Couch was interested in intervening in debates over how to capture and document social life that emerged from sociology’s use of numbers and statistics often procured through surveys, anthropology’s method of ethnography; folklore’s privileging of first-hand stories and the increasingly broad category of "social documentary" used by artists and authors. Couch questioned how fields such as sociology reduced social conditions to statistics and thereby squandered an opportunity to share people’s experiences through narrative storytelling written for a broader reading public.<sup className="tooltip"><span>He joined a growing chorus of intellectuals from the Chicago-school sociologists, sociologist Robert and Helen Lynd’s increasingly anthropological approach as pioneered in <em>Middletown</em>, and the regionalist sociologists in Chapel Hill debating how to understand communities, particularly those in poverty. See Alice O’Connor, <em>Poverty Knowledge: Social Science, Social Policy, and the Poor in Twentieth-Century U.S. History</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001), 55-56.</span><div>[38]</div></sup></p> <p>He was also critical of folklore’s romanticization of the quotidian at the expense of investigations of larger structural social issues, a process that he saw as often reducing people’s lives to nostalgia and quaint folkways that reified the anti-modern and simple-minded stereotypes of the region. While he was persuaded by the descriptive writing that ethnography used to document a subject’s surroundings, he felt this method privileged the voice of the scholar over the research subject. In line with social documentarians, he argued that new methods were needed to accurately illustrate people’s lived realities, and for him, this meant combining academic concepts with literary expression to identify the conditions of the South in order to assess how to address the region’s challenges. Therefore, Couch quickly began to use his position and political capital to advocate for the creation of just such a new project in the FWP.</p> <p>"Somehow they must be given representation, somehow they must be given voice and allowed to speak, in their essential character," Couch argued. If they could speak, he reasoned, communities could help reshape how the nation understood them. In order to capture the voice of the people in their own words, he proposed that the FWP develop a new method of social documentation called "life histories" that could then be used to document the voices of Southerners. He believed that such stories would be of great interest to a general readership already primed by the literary marketplace to purchase stories about the South. Unlike the Southern Literary Renaissance, though, life histories could paint a richer and more nuanced picture of Southern life that, Couch hoped, could spark the type of social change he saw as necessary to address the issues challenging the region.</p> <p>According to Couch, these stories would offer "a human point of view" through written narratives that revealed the interviewee as a "living person who has a past and present" rather than reduced to a few data points in a series of statistics that treated "subjects as abstractions" as often practiced by IRSS scholars and the quantitative School of Sociology.<sup className="tooltip"><span>"Memorandum Concerning Proposed Plans for Work of the Federal Writers’ Project in the South", July 11, 1938.

Couch specifically singles out work by scholars trained in UNC’s Department of Sociology, such as Dr. Jenning J Rhyne, as examples of the limits of current sociology methods.</span><div>[39]</div></sup> The life histories could then be published by UNC Press, just like the North Carolina Guidebook. "It is clear to anyone who has had experience in presenting materials to the reading public, namely the publisher or editor of a newspaper or the head of a publishing firm, that material of this kind will be of interest to the public and will be read if it is made available in good form," Couch wrote with confidence.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[40]</div></sup></p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="‘Life Histories’" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>While Couch’s relationship with Odum had soured by 1938, in large part due to intellectual differences, he did not categorically dismiss the social sciences.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Shiflett, <em>William Terry Couch and the Politics of Academic Publishing: An Editor’s Career as Lightning Rod for Controversy</em>; O’Connor, <em>Poverty Knowledge: Social Science, Social Policy, and the Poor in Twentieth-Century U.S. History</em> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001).</span><div>[41]</div></sup> Rather, Couch believed in the goals of the field, but not the methods in which to document social conditions. While often based on mixed methods such as case studies, interviews, and social surveys, the broad generalizations published by sociologists overlooked, according to critics, an opportunity to capture social truths about a community through the vividness and intimacy of individual stories. In order to seize such an opportunity, he argued "life histories" should not just be data for social scientific generalizations about communities but a way of knowing communities that would be available to the broader public.</p> <figure><img src='img/figure2-3.jpg' alt='figure' onClick={() => props.handleImage(8)}/><figcaption><b>Figure 8.</b> First page of the 1938 memorandum from Couch regarding proposed plans for the life histories.

In <em>Human Factors in Cotton Culture: A Study in the Social Geography of the American South,</em> Vance argued that "the warmth of emotional interest in the South has as far as possible been restrained by an appeal to the cold and impartial fact. It must be admitted, however, that the great human nexus surrounding cotton culture is too intricate to be set forth adequately by statistics and cases."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Rupert Vance, <em>Human Factors in Cotton Culture: A Study in the Social Geography of the American South</em> (Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 1929), vii-ix. Accessed online at: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://archive.org/details/humanfactorsinco00vancrich">[link]</a>.</span><div>[42]</div></sup> Vance used a case studies approach to counter the flattening of cultural complexity produced through statistical generalizations that reduced people to averages and (stereo)types. To create such "emotional interest," Vance wrote detailed, third-person stories about a number of his research subjects that were then used to argue about the ways that "cotton culture" structured Southern society.</p> <p>One case study above the others captured Couch’s imagination, which, interestingly, Vance did not conduct himself.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Vance, <em>Human Factors in Cotton Culture: A Study in the Social Geography of the American South</em> (Chapel Hill: UNC Press, 1929), 259.

In his book, Vance argued that the interview was an "unusual type of feature story" for a newspaper and that an article written by a non-sociologist made "a vivid presentation of one human factor in cotton."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[44]</div></sup> However, the story was seen as exceptional by Vance as it was unusual for those without sociological training to create the type of story that could be considered evidence in a sociological study. Classifying the story as exceptional provided Couch with further evidence that the sociological gaze was too abstract and distant to accurately and intimately document the lives of everyday people, particularly the working class.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Couch thought sociologists would dismiss the SLHP that he suggested using the Vance example if there were objections. See "Memorandum Concerning Proposed Plans for Work of the Federal Writers’ Project in the South", July 11, 1938. Folder 1087 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</span><div>[45]</div></sup> Nevertheless, the value of the story to Vance proved to Couch that an individual’s history and contemporary conditions—written with non-academic prose by persons with no sociological training—were of value to academia. Writers from other fields such as reporting, like MacNeil, were a better fit to write for a broader public.</p> <p>Couch used John Smith’s case study as an archetype, rather than as exceptional, for the SLHP. In outlining the new project to FWP writers, he explained that "no one has attempted to collect such material purely for its human interest, purely for the value of accurate portrayals of individual lives."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid. Couch thought sociologists would dismiss the SLHP that he suggested using the Vance example if there were objections.</span><div>[46]</div></sup> His attention to accuracy in portrayal led Couch to call this new type of methodological writing "life histories" as opposed to "case studies" or "case histories." While case studies and case histories were common qualitative methods in sociology, life histories were not widely used except among the Chicago School of Sociology. Couch disliked case studies and histories because they often created a composite view or a vague abstraction of people rather than focusing on a single person’s life. On the other hand, life histories did focus on a single individual, but did so only to document deviance, which Couch believed was a significant shortcoming. He explained,</p> <blockquote> <p>Life histories have had a partial use heretofore for special purposes in sociology and social work. In sociology, the use has been restricted usually to segments of persons’ lives used to illustrate particular problems, such as juvenile delinquency, adult criminality, and marital frictions. In no case, however, has the method been applied to representatives of the great body of people, allowing each person to tell his own story <em>as it appears to him,</em> including all those details which while deemed non-essential for sociological generalizations, nevertheless, portray in the realest sense the nature and quality of a man’s living…While not important for social diagnosis, these discarded details may well be the ingredients that color the man’s life as an individual. In this sense, life histories are what the social worker hears before he begins to select what he deems relevant and necessary [underline original.]<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(111)}><span>Life Histories as a Method of Revealing People," no date given, Folder 1165 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[47]</div></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Therefore, Couch aimed to reconfigure life histories in three important ways. First, FWP life histories did not focus on the deviant or maladjusted, but rather "representatives of the great body of people."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[48]</div></sup> Second, life histories should center the perspective of the interviewee subject, allowing that person to define what was important in their own life. Third, a life history was not to be a 300-page report but constructed to attract and keep the attention of the more general public but rather aimed at the general public interested in understanding how people lived.</p> <p>Central to this conception was that federal writers, who were not trained sociologists or social workers, should collect the life histories. Rather than creating life histories to prove or disprove a particular point, which is what he understood as Vance’s primary goal, writers were instructed to capture "a human point of view corresponding closely with the point of view of the journalist," Couch wrote.<sup className="tooltip"><span>"Memorandum Concerning Proposed Plans for Work of the Federal Writers’ Project in the South", July 11, 1938. Folder 1087 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</span><div>[49]</div></sup> As journalists, the writers were to simply report back what they heard through informal interviews. From memory, the writer would then write a narrative that included the person’s oral history along with a description of their current conditions.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[50]</div></sup> As one set of instructions stated, "In order for the interview to be successful, you should put at ease the person with whom you are talking and let him ramble on.

However, in the writing style Couch encouraged, which instructed writers to occupy the gaze of a journalist to document compelling stories primarily featuring the interviewee’s voice, the life histories truly became unique. We delve further into the writing style and the rhetorical implications in <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(5)}>Layer 4</span>.</p> <p>Asking writers to report back what they heard did not mean that the writers’ let the interviewee "ramble" without guidance. The life history’s primary distribution mode was to be books by topics including broad categories such as southern life and more specific topics such as mill workers. Moreover, interviewers were given questionnaires that covered topics such as family and labor, which were to be treated as a general guide and not a checklist so that interviewers could respond to the natural direction of the conversations. The books and the questionnaire’s sociological bent, informed the themes covered.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Privileging Work in Life Histories" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>Couch’s ambitions for the SLHP were extensive as he desired to forge a new genre while offering a picture of the South. In a letter to Alsberg outlining his plans, Couch wrote that material similar to Vance’s case histories "ought to be collected from every Southern state, from all types of tenants, sharecroppers, share renders, and renters, and ought to include all the most important types of farming."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(112)}><span>Letter to Harry G.

With the SLHP, Couch added the FWP among the institutions placing a microscope over the region.</p> <p>Steeped in current debates over what to document and how, Couch quickly expanded the scope to other significant economic sectors, including mill workers, lumberers, miners, fishers, and service occupations, and topics such as eating and drinking habits, health and disease, and recreational facilities.<sup className="tooltip"><span>"Memorandum Concerning Proposed Plans for Work of the Federal Writers’ Project in the South", July 11, 1938.

Sharing the decade’s concern with working-class (and mostly White) labor, Couch’s particular focus was documenting the lives of workers in the South by occupation, which emphasized the centrality of labor and positioned subjectivity as based on work.

Moreover, a focus on work and occupations also reflected the major preoccupation of the New Deal - putting America back to work and building an ecosystem of benefits to care for workers and the unemployed alike.</p> <p>In addition to countering stereotypes, Couch believed that accurate stories about these problems would constitute an important step for Southerners, themselves, to address the issues they faced. He argued that President Roosevelt and the New Deal "can do little for us if we refuse to do anything.

For example, despite his concern with new documentary methods, he never took up the significant work undertaken by Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, and James Agee, who posed pointed questions about positionality and privilege in documentary practices.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Retman, <em>Real Folks: Race and Genre in the Great Depression,</em> Chapter 4<em>;</em> Autumn Womack, "‘The Brown Bag of Miscellany’: Zora Neale Hurston and the Practice of Overexposure," <em>Black Camera</em> 7, no. 1 (Fall 2015), 115-133.</span><div>[57]</div></sup> This lack of critical reflection about the relationship between race, gender, and power permeated the structure of SLHP from hiring decisions, interviewing practices, and in the writing and editing of the life histories themselves, which we address further in <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(4)}>Layer 3</span> and <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(5)}>Layer 4</span>. Nonetheless, the SLHP believed the pursuit of more accurate, authentic documents would not only benefit the South, but be a new method of documentation.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Claims to Authenticity" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>Concerns about authenticity, truth, and accessibility were at the forefront of the life histories method. Conveying the region’s truths meant forging an authentic and accessible practice and form. The challenge was how to accurately "portray individual lives" with "emotional interest" while allowing the person "to speak, in their essential character" to reveal "important truths" about Southern society and culture through writing. By attending to these critical issues, Couch and his colleagues hoped to lend authority, credibility, and legitimacy to the published life histories.</p> <p>The process began with hiring "writers" and not academics. Among those hired included creative writers, journalists, secretaries, and educators, with emphasis placed on hiring people who were from the region. Unlike the distant observation often privileged by the social sciences, the proximity of the writers to local communities was seen as an asset because they were tied into local networks and attuned to local history, customs, and politics. Their local knowledge was a resource rather than a hindrance. The hiring practices would also be steeped in ideas of feminized labor and make space for White women writers, which we address further in <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(4)}>Layer 3</span>.</p> <figure><img src='img/figure2-5.jpg' alt='figure' onClick={() => props.handleImage(10)}/><figcaption><b>Figure 10.</b> Letter from Couch to Harris sharing feedback on the life histories method.

Much of the framing about how to conduct and write the life histories came from conversations between Couch and those he saw as the most skilled writers. In one such back and forth between Bernice Harris, who would become one of the most prolific life history writers, and Couch, he explained,</p> <blockquote> <p>You may use your own judgement as to when to write your stories. You should not wait long enough to let details become vague and to get your stories mixed. I believe it is best not to wait long after you have collected material to write each story, but this is a matter on which I think it is best for you to use your own judgement. The one thing to remember here is that we do not want composite pictures. We do not want you to take the characteristics of several persons and put these together into one imaginary person. <em>We want the stories to be photographic inaccuracy but, as you know, a good photographer is one who decides what is important and photographs that rather than trying to photograph everything</em> [emphasis ours].<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(120)}><span>Letter from William Couch to Bernice Kelly Harris, October 20, 1938.

Photographers working for the Department of Agriculture and Farm Security Administration used the camera lens to demonstrate authenticity through the supposed truth represented in photographs.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Pete Daniel et al., <em>Official Images : New Deal Photography</em>; Finnegan, <em>Picturing Poverty: Print Culture and FSA Photographs</em>, xiv.</span><div>[59]</div></sup> Folklorists documented songs and music with audio equipment, allowing people to hear proof of authenticity. However, federal writers did not have cameras or audio equipment, which was too expensive and cumbersome to use at the scale of the project. Nor was it necessary as they believed that the life histories could reveal truths through words, which represented a significant contribution to a decade bent on documenting the real.</p> <p>This question about how to both create and demonstrate authenticity as well as what the form and specific methods of a life history looked like became areas of debate among Couch, SLHP administrators, and writers. While Couch had larger ideas about the potential of life histories as a genre of documentation that could give insight into people’s lived experience in new ways that extended beyond the South, he had to contend with competing projects in the FWP vying for limited resources as well as the desires of state administrators and writers in the South. This complicated constellation of people and forces contributed to what became over 1200 life histories in the SLHP before it was forced to dismantle at the end of 1939. <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(4)}>Layer 3</span> now turns to an exploration of this process of negotiation over the new genre of a life history using mapping techniques that visualize the collection at scale.</p> </Collapsible> </div>
