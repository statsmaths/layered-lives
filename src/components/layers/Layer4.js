With the flagship project of the guidebooks well underway, FWP administrators sought new projects. FWP Director Henry Alsberg and his Washington team were particularly interested in projects that promoted a pluralistic vision of the U.S. As a result, the FWP launched several new initiatives, including Social-ethnic Studies, the Folklore Project, and the Ex-slave Narrative Project.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(115)}><span>Memorandum: "Program of the Federal Writers’ Project for the coming year" from Henry Alsberg, October 1938.

In a similar vein to the Folklore Project, the Ex-slave Narrative program sought to document the experiences of formerly enslaved Americans before those memories were lost.</p> <p>Amid these new documentary efforts, William Couch, now Director of the FWP’s Southeast Region, lobbied to add the life histories project to this list. Couch received approval from Alsberg in October 1938. In a letter to all state directors, Alsberg offered his enthusiastic support for the project and its potential to produce a large amount of material to aid in studying the current conditions in the American South.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[2]</div></sup> Through the end of 1939, the SLHP collected and wrote over 1,200 life histories, an impressive feat given the fact that the actual methods of collection and writing conventions were not established at the onset.</p> <p>Mapping the locations <ChangeMapLink value="geo_all">[map]</ChangeMapLink> of the interviews tells a complicated story about the reach and limitation of these life histories, provoking questions that have not been previously explored in relation to the SLHP: Why do the life histories tend to clump together in specific areas? Why are interviews of people from common professions spread out over the region? Why do most writers only collect interviews in a small area? Why were most of the life histories written by women? Why were there only 7 Black writers? Why were the vast majority of interviewees identified as White, a small amount identified as Black, and almost no other races represented in the collection of life histories? Analyzing the complicated rhetorical ecosystem in which the life histories were produced helps to address these questions. Therefore this layer proceeds by moving back and forth between the map and archival evidence, linked throughout the text, to analyze the rhetorical exigence or circumstances that allowed for the creation of the SLHP. We begin with mapping out the ecosystem of FWP work, noting the "competing" and "complementary" projects within the larger organization and how the field of sociology and sociological thinking shaped the scope of the SLHP. We then move to unpack how the ethos of writers was established to create notions of who was best qualified to perform the interviewing, writing, and editing of the life histories. Together, these interrelated factors shaped the SLHP’s version of the American South as defined through occupation and against a racialized Black/White binary.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="An Ecosystem of Documentary" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>As <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(2)}>Layer 1</span> and <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(3)}>Layer 2</span> demonstrate, the FWP emerged with the desire to create a pluralistic version of American identity. Jerrold Hirsch describes the FWP as both "ideological and reformist,"<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 3.</span><div>[3]</div></sup> operating within a discourse that attempted to "reconcile romantic nationalism with cultural pluralism - two isms that seem diametrically opposed."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 4.</span><div>[4]</div></sup> These FWP programs aimed to "unite Americans, individuals, and groups with conflicting interests, while ignoring issues that divided them, and therefore the project also created a conservative myth that pointed to a harmonious future without indicating how a change from current circumstances to a better future could be achieved."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 3.</span><div>[5]</div></sup></p> <p>​​Such a vision of a harmonious future was constructed by relying on the documentation of an American past that sought to include voices that had previously been excluded from a version of American identity that saw its origin as exclusively Anglo-Saxon. These documentary efforts focused, as Retman explains, on displaying "the vernacular traditions of historically marginalized groups to tell a story of national fortitude and exceptionalism."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Retman, <em>Real Folks</em>, 13.</span><div>[6]</div></sup> Of particular interest were groups who, as Carado describes, were "‘foreign in a domestic sense’" who were accorded a racially and temporally liminal status, subject to an ‘inclusionary form of exclusion,’ positioned both inside and outside the national imagination as ‘original’ peoples."<sup className="tooltip"><span>As cited in Retman, <em>Real Folks</em>, 14-5.</span><div>[7]</div></sup></p> <p>The SLHP vied for resources against other FWP projects that already claimed to focus on such exceptional groups. The Folklore project was concerned with documenting an organic past by focusing on the stories and folkways of "Native Americans, African Americans, and poor rural whites."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Retman, <em>Real Folks</em>, 14.</span><div>[8]</div></sup> The Ex-slave narratives worked to incorporate and in many ways move past slavery by capturing the histories of formerly enslaved individuals in such a way as to paint slavery as banal paternalism, rather than dwelling in "the forms of forms of violence and domination."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hartman, <em>Scenes of Subjection</em>, 6</span><div>[9]</div></sup> that constituted chattel slavery as well as the everyday acts of resistance. Additionally, the Social-ethnic Studies analyzed how the cultures of European immigrants contributed to the pluralistic notion of American identity.</p> <p>Shaped by FWP’s institutional ecosystem as well as their own ideological commitments, Couch and other SLHP administrators crafted the South by emphasizing poor Whites and African Americans as native southerners, common rather than exceptional. In this way, the SLHP carved out space for itself by excluding Native American and ethnic communities as well as downplaying the significance of stories that focused on slavery from formerly enslaved individuals as the purview of the other FWP projects. This focus on mostly poor Whites and African Americans along "the color line" crafted a notion of Southern identity that didn’t include ethnic communities and Native Amerians.<sup className="tooltip"><span>DuBois, <em>Soul of Black Folk</em>, 5.</span><div>[10]</div></sup> These decisions were informed by southern segregation, which, as Grace Hale describes, made a "new collective white identity across lines of gender and class and a new regional distinctiveness." However, this whiteness that was constructed against blackness was "always contingent, always fragile, always uncertain."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hale, <em>Making Whiteness</em>, 8.</span><div>[11]</div></sup> Fragile yet dominant, as we also demonstrate in our discussion of creating the data (See Methods), the Black/White binary served as a powerful racial configuration for the SLHP that provided a way for the project to distinguish itself, a distinction that played into white supremacist logic.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Social-ethnic Studies and Race" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <figure><img src='img/figure3-1.jpg' alt='figure' onClick={() => props.handleImage(11)}/><figcaption><b>Figure 11.</b> Graph of Interviewees by Race and Ethnicity. image </figcaption></figure> <p>The map of interviews is faceted to reveal that most SLHP interviewees were situated along a Black/White binary in which other racialized and ethnic groups are largely invisible. In total, 891 of the interviews <ChangeMapLink value="geo_white_interviewee">[map]</ChangeMapLink> were conducted with White interviewees and 271 with Black interviewees <ChangeMapLink value="geo_black_interviewee">[map]</ChangeMapLink>. Also included were a small number of other racialized groups, which would be considered ethnic categories by contemporary terms. These include 9 Cuban interviewees, 50 Greek interviewees, 1 Spaniard, and 1 Chinese interviewee <ChangeMapLink value="geo_ethnic">[map]</ChangeMapLink>.<sup className="tooltip"><span>These numbers are based on the SLHP’s recorded metadata. As described in the Methods section, we also include an additional ethnic category that identifies slightly more interviewees of Cuban and Greek descent. The extra counts are small compared to the official counts; there are 10 Cuban interviewees and 56 Greek interviews using this ethnic category.</span><div>[12]</div></sup> Moreover, the location of these racial and ethnic groups is also interesting. While White and Black interviewees seem to spread out amongst each state in the Southeast region, some ethnic groups are largely located in specific areas. For example, all of the Cuban interviewees are located in Hillsborough County, Florida. This striking pattern raises the questions of why the SLHP decided to classify racial categories in this way and why the project largely ignored the many other racial, ethnic, and indigenous groups who lived in the area. To understand how these racialized results occurred, one must begin by unpacking how and why the project distinguished its mission from Social-ethnic Studies, a competing project within the FWP.</p> <p>The Social-ethnic Studies project began shortly before the SLHP and was led by Dr. Morton W. Royse. Royse earned his Ph.D. from Columbia and studied under John Dewey. His early research on ethnic cultures focused on European minoritized communities. He went on to work with the Worker’s Education Bureau of America, and then served as head of a teacher training institute in Puerto Rico.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 27-28.</span><div>[13]</div></sup> Royse largely rejected the idea of the "melting pot", preferring to think of the country as a "‘composite of immigrants.’"<sup className="tooltip"><span>Susan Schulten, "How to See Colorado: The Federal Writers’ Project, American Regionalism, and the ‘Old New Western History,’" The Western Historical Quarterly, 2005, 60.</span><div>[14]</div></sup> He argued "the Polish, Irish, Greek, or French population in traditionally white Anglo-Saxon Protestant New England or elsewhere ‘is American culture, not merely a contributor to American culture…their culture is contemporary American culture as truly as is the culture of IowaAmerican farmers or Appalachian-American hill-billies.’"<sup className="tooltip"><span>As quoted in Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 137-8.</span><div>[15]</div></sup> These convictions greatly influenced the direction of Social-ethnic Studies as Royse positioned the project as providing evidence of the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural nature of the United States, which FWP administrators argued should be seen as a national strength.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 33.</span><div>[16]</div></sup> He explained that the project’s goal was to embrace "the history and role of nationality groups in modern industrial society...to present a composite picture of America," while taking care "not to overstress the separateness and peculiarities of a group. The aim was to show how the group functions in the life of the community...and how it contributes to cultural diversity."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(116)}><span>"Manual for Social-Ethnic Studies," 1938. Folder 1111 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[17]</div></sup></p> <p>To accomplish this aim, the Social-ethnic Studies project focused on documenting "the life of ethnic groups in various communities, including their cultural backgrounds and activities" through "intensive studies of single groups, cross-sectional studies of whole communities, and extensive studies of larger areas."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(117)}><span>"Memorandum: Program of the Federal Writers’ Project for the coming year" from Henry Alsberg, October 1938.

Folder 1111 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[18]</div></sup> Moreover, while field workers were encouraged to use their community affiliation to gain entrance into the communities of study, the tenor of the project was scholarly and decidedly social scientific. In the Manual for Social-ethnic Studies, Royse directs field workers to collect "field data, including selected interviews, personal histories, and documentary material" as well as fully cooperate with "consultants drawn from the ranks of State writers, historians, folklorists, anthropologists, sociologists, economists, etc."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[19]</div></sup></p> <p>SLHP administrators used the Social-ethnic Studies’ focus on data collection of entire ethnic communities and embraced the scholarly community as their primary audience as a way to strongly distinguish their project from the studies. Rather than quantitative social survey data, SLHP collected qualitative stories of individuals from their own point of view, focusing on "common" Southerners. SLHP writers documented the interviewee’s articulation of their own experiences, not writing about them. Therefore, the type of data the SLHP collected, Couch argued, was unique because it came from the perspective of the interviewees themselves.</p> <p>The SLHP also saw a key difference in the type of interviewees they selected. Deviating from Royse’s argument that immigrant culture was part and parcel of American culture, SLHP administrators viewed the Social-ethnic Studies’ purpose as documenting the unique and unusual aspects of American society and culture, rather than the "common" American. North Carolina State Director Bjorkman explained to his writers that these other projects "deal with communities of an exceptional type that deviate in their origins and customs from the more common types of American life."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(118)}><span>"Memorandum on Project Work," from Edwin Bjorkman, November 15, 1938. Folder 1101 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[20]</div></sup> In contrast, the SLHP was to focus on these "common types," or as Couch put it, "the kind of life that is lived by the majority of people in the South."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Couch, <em>These Are Our Lives</em>, 419.</span><div>[21]</div></sup></p> <p>This decision to focus on ‘common types’ functioned as a signifier to the almost exclusively White SLHP staff to select interviewees along a color line that marked the segregated South as Black and White. Bernice Harris, one of the first writers on the SLHP project, picked up on this cue, asking for clarification in a letter to Couch, "are the subjects to be white only? There are so many interesting colored share-croppers. ‘Ghent’, the Negro section here, has some social importance and much human interest."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(119)}><span>Letter to W.T. Couch from Bernice Harris, October 15, 1938. Folder 1095 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[22]</div></sup> Couch replied, "you should collect stories about both whites and Negroes. Pay not attention whatever to racial lines in the collection of your material, except that in stories about Negroes it should be made clear that the subjects are Negroes."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(120)}><span>Letter to Bernice Harris from W.T. Couch, October 20, 1938. Folder 1096 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[23]</div></sup> This exchange between Harris and Couch illustrates that there was at first some doubt in Harris’ mind if ‘common’ included African American interviewees, demonstrating how whiteness functions as the standard and neutral state. Couch’s reply emphasizes that the life histories are to cross the color line, a line seen as a Black/White binary in which blackness must be marked.</p> <p>To mark and organize these common types, SLHP administrators instructed writers to document demographic information relating to the interviewee. This information constitutes important metadata for each interviewee that worked to mark which common type the person’s life history spoke to. In a memorandum to all state directors, Assistant Regional Director Walter Cutter states, "It is requested that hereafter the following heading be placed on all stories:<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(121)}><span>"Memorandum: Heading to be Placed on All Life Histories," from Walter Cutter, January 5, 1939.

The interviewee’s name is to be read with their race, followed by their location and occupation. Therefore, before the location in the South is demonstrated or the specific occupation, race is marked as a signifier of the interviewee’s name. Moreover, the writer is given three possible racial categories: "white," "Negro," or "other."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Rather than repeating what is now considered a racial slur, we will be using the word "Black." Please see Methods for a more in-depth discussion about terms.</span><div>[25]</div></sup> The use of a capital letter in the instructions further indicates the way that blackness was marked as a definitive category and whiteness was a capacious default. This categorization inscribes a Black/White binary onto the racialized system in the South. Anyone whose racial categorization did not fall into this binary was grouped as "other;" thereby erasing ethnic and indigenous communities that did not fall within this binary.<sup className="tooltip"><span>To read more about the use of racial categories, please see <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(7)}>Methods</span>.</span><div>[26]</div></sup> They were literally othered.</p> <p>This framing of Southern identity through a Black/White binary supports the distinction between the SLHP and Social-ethnic Studies. SLHP administrators effectively encouraged writers to avoid interviewing subjects from different ethnic, indigenous, or other racial communities as that was considered the purview of Social-ethnic Studies. Understanding the efforts that the SLHP made to distinguish itself from the Social-ethnic Studies helps to explain why the data revealed in the map shows an absence of communities from diverse racial, ethnic, and indigenous communities. However, close readings of these life histories reveal that many of the life histories that were not marked as Black or ‘other’ did, in fact, discuss immigration either through the interviewee’s own experiences or that of their parents. While the interviewees discussed their relationship to different ethnic and racial communities, writers did not mark them as such because they were read as White. As historian Matthew Jacobson argues, "in racial matters above all else, the eye that sees is ‘a means of perception conditioned by the tradition in which its possessor has been reared.’"<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jacobson, <em>Whiteness of a Different Color</em>, 10.</span><div>[27]</div></sup> Therefore, such decisions among the almost exclusively White SLHP staff reflected racialized ideals at the time that Jacobson describes as a period in which "whiteness was reconsolidated: the late nineteenth century’s probationary white groups were now remade and granted the scientific stamp of authenticity as the unitary Caucasian race - an earlier era’s Celts, Slavs, Hebrews, Iberics, and Saracens, among others, had become the Caucasians so familiar to our own visual economy and racial lexicon."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jacobson, <em>Whiteness of a Different Color</em>, 8.</span><div>[28]</div></sup> In other words, groups that were once labeled as ethnic were increasingly understood as "white" and enjoying the cultural, social, and political benefits of whiteness.</p> <p>While powerful, this reconsolidated understanding of whiteness was nonetheless unstable and fragile,<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hale, <em>Making Whiteness</em>.</span><div>[29]</div></sup> which can be seen with the inclusion of the 50 Greek interviewees <ChangeMapLink value="geo_ethnic">[map]</ChangeMapLink> that stand out in contrast to the general lack of marking of ethnicity. While these 50 interviewees were specifically marked as ‘Greek,’ there were seven life histories that included stories of Greek immigration and heritage but were not given any ethnic signifier allowing the default norm of White to stand-in for race. Part of the reason behind the inclusion of so many marked ‘Greek’ interviewees is a result of the fact that those who were marked as ‘Greek’ were part of a ‘Greek Study’ sponsored by the "Federation of Learned Greeks" and the "Greek Orthodox Church in America" originally under the auspices of Royce and the Social-ethnic project, and was later thought to present interesting ‘personal’ histories that could be included as life histories.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(122)}><span>Memorandum on a Greek Study from Edwin Bjorkmon in Life History Collection, June 7, 1939.

Moreover, the fact that the vast majority of the interviewees were actually collected as part of the Social-ethnic Studies demonstrates the emphasis on collecting "common types" for the SLHP signaled and reaffirmed the equation of South as being defined along "the color line" of Black and White, in which all other those not able to fit within the binary were grouped together, dismissed as ‘other.’</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Folklore and a Focus on Occupation" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>Mapping the occupations <ChangeMapLink value="geo_occupation">[map]</ChangeMapLink> associated with the life histories reveals a core set of professions that are captured across the American South.

Along with these most common trades, there are dozens of interviews with cooks, fishermen, and preachers. Mixed in with these large categories are one-off stories showing the wide range of professions available in the region, such as life histories from one peanut vendor, an embalmer, a preacher, and even a self-proclaimed "loan shark."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Life History of A.

The SLHP’s focus on economic conditions is in large part a response to its relationship to the FWP’s Folklore Project.</p> <p>The Folklore Project of the FWP was launched in 1936 and was initially led by John Lomax. The unit focused on the collection of oral material such as songs, stories, and dialect.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(123)}><span>"Memorandum: Notes on Dr. Botkin’s Conference," December 1, 1938.

Unlike other modes of expression, such as newspapers and books, folklore was seen to be outside of academic and commercial modes of dissemination.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Stewart, <em>Long Past Slavery</em>, 41.</span><div>[33]</div></sup> The SLHP initially had chosen to distinguish itself from the Folklore Project by focusing on documenting an individual’s history that led to their contemporary circumstances rather than focusing on stories from the past. This distinction, however, became insufficient when the Folklore Project was reorganized under the Direction of Benjamin Botkin in early 1938.</p> <p>As a professor of English at the University of Oklahoma and trained in English literature departments, Botkin brought "a literary sensibility" to the study of folklore and refused the traditional configuration of folklore studies as just an approach to preserving the past.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Botkin received the following degrees: Harvard (B.A., 1920); Columbia (M.A. 1921); University of Nebraska (Ph.D., 1931) as cited in Lawrence R. Rodgers and Jerrold Hirsch, <em>America’s Folklorist: BA Botkin and American Culture</em> (University of Oklahoma Press, 2014), p. 2.</span><div>[34]</div></sup> Shaped by the field of anthropology, he viewed folklore as also an ongoing process in the here and now that offered sights into contemporary life rather than a field defined by the search for "pure, uncontaminated lore" as traditional folklorists often did.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch and Rodgers, <em>America’s Folklorist: BA Botkin and American Culture</em>, 8; Rukowski, <em>Literary Legacies of the Federal Writers’ Project,</em> 21.</span><div>[35]</div></sup> Folklore, in other words, was also responding to and offering insights into how communities were navigating the present, from the economic impact of the Great Depression to the effects of industrialization to questions about local, regional, and national identity.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Rachel C. Jackson, "Locating Oklahoma: Critical Regionalism and Transrhetorical Analysis in the Composition Classroom," <em>College Composition and Communication</em>, 2014, 308.</span><div>[36]</div></sup> They were not just documenting stories to understand past beliefs, norms, and values but instead a lens into contemporary culture. Guided by the belief that every group had folklore, the project also supported FWP officials’ effort to document and circulate an indigenous culture, which could serve as the evidence of national identity at a time when faith in the nation was fragile.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Stewart, <em>Long Past Slavery</em>, 41; Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 182.</span><div>[37]</div></sup></p> <p>The expanded scope of the Folklore Project was met with approval from FWP administrators, who understood the work of the Folklore Project and the Social-ethnic Studies as complementary. In fact, the FWP hoped that the same field workers would collect material for both the Folklore project and Social-ethnic Studies. As the Manual on Social-ethnic Studies explained, "The Social-ethnic studies deal with the whole life of a group or community, including cultural backgrounds and activities: the folklore studies deal with a body of lore in relation to the life of a group or community."<sup className="tooltip"><span>"Manual for Social-Ethnic Studies", 1938. Folder 1111 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</span><div>[38]</div></sup> Folklore was understood as demonstrating how cultural traditions and beliefs were built and handed down over generations. Capturing the lore of these groups, which included significant attention to poor White communities, African Americans, and Native Americans helped to enforce the notion of American folk-ness rooted in a pluralistic past.</p> <p>To accomplish their goals, the Folklore Project sent field workers to collect "personal stories" from individuals. To capture folklore, Botkin believed fieldworkers should begin by asking informants about their personal histories. When interviews progressed well, these individual stories would expand to capture the experiences, histories, and even fantasies of entire communities. By engaging directly in the process of telling and re-telling these stories, interviewees were uniquely positioned to witness and capture entire folk histories.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(117)}><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 184. </span><div>[39]</div></sup> Asking for personal histories was an avenue for collecting folklore. The person’s history offered a frame for understanding the context that created and circulated a piece of folklore. These materials were envisioned both to document as well as be mined for folk culture.</p> <p>Botkin’s use of personal histories to gain insight into folklore meant that Couch had to be clear about how the SLHP documented unique and valuable information. To do this, Couch made two important moves in framing the project. First, he positioned the project as focusing on the South’s occupation sectors by drawing on the national concern that the South was not sufficiently progressing with economic reforms. Second, Couch drew on sociology, despite his frustrations with the field. He believed that he could take a common method in the field known as "case studies" and transform them into readable stories published in the form of books for a reading public, which meant a primarily White affluent audience.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Monty Noam Penkower, The Federal Writers’ Project ; a Study in Government Patronage of the Arts (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1977), 152.</span><div>[40]</div></sup> The focus on <em>what</em> and <em>how</em> became key to arguments about the purpose and novelty of the SLHP.</p> <p>To distinguish Botkin’s use of personal histories to gain insight into folklore from the SLHP, Couch used a sociological frame to argue that life histories were concerned with documenting social structures such as education, family, and health rather than cultures such as beliefs, ideas, and values. Yet, like Botkin and the field of Sociology from which he adapted his method, he believed the individual stories, what he called "word pictures", could be put together to draw a composite album of a social group. Given the constraints also shaped by their relationship to the Social-ethnic Studies as well as national concerns about the state of the South, the SLHP focused on "common types" in the region organized by occupational sectors.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 185.</span><div>[41]</div></sup></p> <p>By focusing the scope of the project on occupational types, Couch believed that the project would be able to address the source of the social problems in the South. As discussed in <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(2)}>Layer 1</span>, President Roosevelt defined the South as "economic problem #1," which exemplified how the South was thought of as having social problems that both led to the Great Depression and prevented the region from recovering more quickly. While Roosevelt’s framing suggests that it was the social issues that led to economic problems, many Southern progressives, especially the Regionalists in Chapel Hill, as well as progressives in national offices in the FWP saw the causation as flowing in the opposite direction: economic problems caused the social issues in the South. The proposal of capturing people’s life histories from specific occupational sectors was thought to be one way to gain insight into the common problems faced by these workers. In discussing the value of the life histories, Couch explains, "this material makes clearer than ever before the problems which have been faced in this region, and illuminates, almost startlingly, the human factors and interests involved. It seems to me that knowledge of such material is basic to any real understanding of our problems and people."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(125)}><span>Letter to Dr. Douglass Freeman from W.T.

This equation is significant as these instructions tell writers how to define Southern workers through the "typical" types worthy of documenting. These typical Southern workers are positioned as occupying a working-class primarily coming from either agriculture or industry with a keen desire to work despite economic and market forces subverting their efforts to gain employment.</p> <p>To argue that these were typical stories across the American South, the SLHP needed to collect similar stories from people all across the region. This goal is the primary reason that interviews from various professions, most notably farmers and industrial labor, are seen across the region as the map demonstrates <ChangeMapLink value="geo_occupation">[map]</ChangeMapLink>. However, one can also note a large number of outliers, including occupations such as embalmer and preacher. With the project’s prioritization with the FWP, the scope expanded to include more occupations, which helped paint a broader picture of the region. Even with the expanded focus, though, documenting the "typical" version of each specific type of worker remained the goal. So, the SLHP collected several life histories to find the best example. Taken together, the rhetoric of "common" Southerners from "typical types" of occupations signaled the race and class of the interviewees that writers were encouraged to select for life histories.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Ex-Slave Narratives" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>While the focus on common Southerners in typical occupations marked the SLHP as distinct from the Social-ethnic Studies program and the Folklore project, another site of negotiation over the scope of the SLHP was with the Ex-Slave Narrative project. SLHP administrators also worked to distinguish its goals from the quickly growing project. Drawing boundaries with this project again evidenced the role of whiteness in shaping the types of histories that warranted collection.</p> <p>In a memorandum to all state directors discussing the important projects that the directors needed to focus on in the upcoming year of 1939, Alsberg writes, "In addition to ethnic group and folklore studies, there will be a number of projects carried on covering Negro life throughout the country, Negro folklore, etc." Among these projects included the "collection of stories of ex-slaves. About 2,500 of these have already been collected. Eventually, these ex-slave stories will be compiled, classified and used for a publication containing a critical analysis of the material.

Often perfunctory, the inclusion of Black voices extended to their role as interviewees, but not writers, as the map demonstrates. Despite the significance of stories of enslavement from interviewees on understanding Southern identity, Couch was not interested in collecting such material. In a letter to state directors, Couch wrote, "In the life histories the emphasis is on the present and the past is treated only to throw light on the present. <em>Ex-slave stories that relate mainly to the past will not be acceptable as life histories</em>. If they are brought up to the present through consideration of their full life experiences, including their children and grandchildren and their present mode of living, then they may be acceptable as life histories.

These topics can be seen in the text analysis in <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(5)}>Layer 4</span>.</span><div>[53]</div></sup> By distinguishing the SLHP from the Ex-slave Narrative project, Couch crafted a notion of Southern identity that was largely devoid of the profound experiences of enslavement that were, in reality, inextricably weaved into the very notion of the South, and America. The SLHP, except for a few writers, would try to avoid the wake of slavery.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Christina Sharpe, In the Wake: On Blackness and Being (Durham, Duke University Press, 2016).</span><div>[54]</div></sup></p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Sociology and Life History Configurations" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>Whereas the map of occupations illustrates the goal of capturing a core set of professions from all across the region, the map showing where individual writers captured life histories <ChangeMapLink value="geo_writers">[map]</ChangeMapLink> provides a different pattern. Each writer, with very few exceptions, only conducted life histories in a narrow geographic region. The map shows, for example, W. O. Saunders’ focus on the North Carolina coast, W. W. Dixon’s work near Columbia, South Carolina, and Barbara Berry Dorsey’s collection of life histories near St. Petersburg, Florida. In most cases, the regions of focus for each writer also corresponded to where a writer lived. Writers constructed life histories within their own geographic communities. Whereas the focus on occupations was spurred by the desire to distinguish the SLHP from the Folklore Project’s anthropological questions, the desire to have local writers can be understood as a desire to differentiate life histories from those prevailing methods that dominated Sociology.</p> <p>As the larger field of Sociology, Couch looked past the work of Du Bois and the Atlanta School to center his arguments in relation to the Chicago and Chapel Hill schools.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Earl Wright, "WEB Du Bois, Howard W.

Thomas’s <em>The Polish Peasant in Europe and America</em> (1918). They were credited with the shift from a philosophical to a scientific approach grounded in empiricism because of their use of "human documents," which included introducing a new form of qualitative data that they called a life history.

The collection of histories became associated with White women’s labor while White male academics used them to formulate new sociological theories, a gendered labor ideology that influenced SLHP hiring practices. Interestingly though, Couch seemed to have been unfamiliar with the use of the term life history among the Chicago sociologists. His letters indicate a genuine belief that the term was original to the SLHP. His unfamiliarity with the term life history in other areas is unsurprising as the concept of collecting an individual’s personal histories was defined by various terms.</p> <p>By the mid-1930s, collecting personal histories was a common method in Sociology, primarily associated with social work and the emerging field of criminology.<sup className="tooltip"><span>John Dollard, <em>Criteria for the life history</em>, (Peter Smith: New York 1949), 189.</span><div>[57]</div></sup> "So closely related are these various kinds of case studies that it is impossible, for all practical purposes, to draw a clear-cut distinction between a case study, a case study, a case history, and a life history of an individual", wrote UNC Sociology Professor Katherine Jocher in 1928 for <em>Social Forces</em>. The slippage between terms in the field meant that the method, and debates over the method, were often under the more popular terms of "case histories" and "case studies." This was the case for Rupert Vance, Couch’s primary interlocutor, and from whom he drew inspiration for the life histories as discussed in detail in <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(3)}>Layer 2</span>.</p> <p>To capture stories of "typical" Southern workers, Couch and SLHP administrators found Sociology’s case studies intriguing. However, Couch did not think the increasingly favored statistical and data-driven approaches in sociology could motivate a general readership to learn about the social problems in the South or social problems in general. They abstracted not only the people but the problems and missed an opportunity to persuade people into action. Instead, he saw promise in the case study approach, specifically the method of life histories, if this method could be repurposed for a popular audience and to focus on common types rather than those defined as deviant.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(129)}><span>"Memorandum Concerning Proposed Plans for Work of the Federal Writers’ Project in the South," July 11, 1938, Folder 1087 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[58]</div></sup></p> <p>Case studies "are technically written for a technical audience" and "restricted usually to segments of persons’ lives used to illustrate particular problems, such as problems of juvenile delinquency, adult criminality, and marital frictions," he wrote.<sup className="tooltip"><span>"Life Histories as a Method of Revealing People," no date given, Folder 1165 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</span><div>[59]</div></sup> Instead, Couch argued for a different purpose and reader. Rather than focusing on "deviant" segments of the population, he was interested in "representatives of the great body of people" in which each person would tell "his own story <em>as it appears to him</em> including all those details which while deemed non-essential for sociological generalizations, nevertheless, portray in the realest sense the nature and quality of a man’s living [underline original]."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[60]</div></sup></p> <p>Additionally, Couch objected to the assumption within the discipline that "only sociologists can get case histories that are worth getting."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(129)}><span>"Memorandum Concerning Proposed Plans for Work of the Federal Writers’ Project in the South," July 11, 1938, Folder 1087 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[61]</div></sup> Instead, he believed that non-academic writers would be better able to collect information from subjects because they are more closely related to the subjects’ situations, especially writers from the South. Moreover, they would not have the disciplinary trappings of sociology, so they would be more open to relating the life history as the interviewee told it. Couch explains, "the approach to this subject by the workers on the Federal Writers’ Project will be from a human point of view corresponding closely with the point of view of the journalist, except that certain simple techniques will be established and followed to ensure the greatest possible accuracy in the histories are collected."</p> <p>The entanglement with sociology was driven largely because of the initial purpose of the SLHP: to understand a sociological problem through empirical data. Yet, the kind of empirical data desired was not quantitative but qualitative. As the field of Sociology desired authority through becoming a quantitative social science, the SLHP collected sociological data but through individual <em>stories</em> from the perspective of the <em>individuals themselves</em> that were meant to be read in aggregate to shed light on the social conditions of a region. While Couch’s ambitions for the SLHP far exceeded the immediate social issues of the region, for he hoped this "new literary genre" would animate other domains and find yet unknown purposes, the immediate concerns about the economic and, therefore, social health of the region deeply shaped the genre information.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(184)}><span>Ibid. </span><div>[62]</div></sup></p> <p>As a result, the project became focused on two primary aims. One was to document the region in a particular configuration – through a Black/White binary categorized by occupation. The second was to forge a new literary genre for sociological knowledge for a broader public. In this case, they identified their primary audience as an affluent White audience beyond the academy, for their social and cultural power in U.S. society made them powerful voices that shaped U.S. social policy. To reach this audience, women writers became central.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="Feminized Labor" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>Like other growing disciplines in the early 20th century, sociology was influenced by gendered and racialized ideas of expertise and work. As mostly White professors residing in institutions of higher education worked to solidify sociology as social science and as an academic discipline, they were joined by White women forging approaches to social services across the nation. The settlement movement emerging at the turn of the 20th century ushered in a female-led sphere dedicated to social work among low-income communities. Often founded and staffed by women, settlement homes opened across the United States in primarily urban spaces functioning as a community center offering social services. While each settlement was shaped by the ideological bent of the founders and the needs of their specific communities, and often shared task was to acculturate lower-income communities into White middle class, and often Christian, values. They joined a larger racialized cultural and social logic that sought to mold groups into whiteness.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jacobson, <em>Whiteness of a Different Color</em></span><div>[63]</div></sup> These new social welfare organizations participated in a larger conversation about social services amid the industrial revolution, urbanization, and immigration.

Despite the fact that UNC opened a School of Social Work in 1920 that quickly became a leader in the field, Couch almost never mentioned the school in his correspondences about SLHP hiring to Washington. This omission likely resulted from the fact that Couch wanted to distinguish life histories from case histories. Couch was concerned that those trained in sociological approaches - specifically the case history approach, which was a part of formal social work training - filtered out important information because they "treated their subjects as abstractions."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(129)}><span>"Memorandum Concerning Proposed Plans for Work of the Federal Writers’ Project in the South," July 11, 1938, Folder 1087 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[70]</div></sup> Instead, the interviewees in life histories needed to speak for themselves through rich and well developed stories that obtained a mark of literary excellence. This concern helps explain why Couch always positioned those gathering life histories as writers, insisting that they mark themselves as such on the life histories, rather than field workers as other projects like the Social-ethnic Studies did. Yet, Couch and other SLHP administrators relied on gendered assumptions about women’s abilities to connect, ask questions, listen, and then write down the stories, the same rhetorical logic that motivated the field of social work. Such assumptions are evidenced when examining the data concerning who were the most prolific writers in the SLHP.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="A Focus on White Women Writers" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>Looking at the map of women writers <ChangeMapLink value="geo_women_writers">[map]</ChangeMapLink> and men writers <ChangeMapLink value="geo_men_writers">[map]</ChangeMapLink> shows that a significant amount of the life histories were written by women.

A large portion of the interviews was written by a small number of writers. There were 30 writers who wrote ten or more life histories. Together, those 30 writers wrote 677 life histories, slightly over half of the collection. Within this group of the most prolific writers, 11 were men, among which only one identified as Black (Robert McKinney), and 19 were White women. These 19 women wrote nearly 40 percent of the life histories.

The key role of women writers in the project is particularly striking for a time when women were largely excluded from the workplace and had only been given the right to vote a mere two decades earlier. Two notable causes pushed the SLHP to use women writers so prolifically. First, gendered notions that associated women with the domestic sphere led to the idea that they were better able to gain access to interviewees within their homes and to put them at ease while sharing their stories, traits that also led women to occupy central positions in social work. Second, women were seen as good communicators and recorders of information, the same gendered thinking that led them to be favored for stenographer and secretary positions.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Jessica Enoch, <em>Domestic Occupations: Spatial Rhetorics and Women’s Work</em> (SIU Press, 2019); David Gold and Catherine L.

These raced and gendered practices can be seen in the way that SLHP administrators specially selected a handful of White women for non-relief positions, the same female writers who would become the most prolific writers during the life of the project. Among these women were the two writers who wrote more life histories than any other writer: Bernice Harris with 85 life histories and Ida Moore with 51 life histories.

Couch felt that her descriptions of these rural communities were much richer and authentic than other representations of the rural South, such as those by Erskine Caldwell.</p> <p>Couch’s desire to hire Harris because of her ability to write "authentic and interesting" stories was also rooted in her connections with farming communities in her town of Seaboard, NC. He believed that she could use these connections to gain access to people willing to give their life histories. Because her husband owned and operated a cotton gin, Harris knew many people in the farming community. Together with her connections in the community, Harris believed that she was well-positioned to put people at ease. She explained that together with the many economic problems in the region was "the need of the lonely and forgotten to tell <em>all</em> to a sympathetic listener [italics original]."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Bernice Harris, <em>Southern Savory</em> (University of North Carolina Press, 1964), 184.</span><div>[81]</div></sup></p> <p>Harris’s description of herself as a sympathetic listener, evoking her emotive abilities, reveals how she deployed gendered assumptions that see women as more ‘naturally’ emotional, as a means of establishing her ethos, or credibility, as a uniquely capable interviewer. As many scholars of feminist rhetorics demonstrate, ethos does not dwell only in the speaker (or rhetor), but rather also with the audience. Establishing credibility and trust often requires understanding and appealing to the beliefs of the audience.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ryan, et al., <em>Rethinking Ethos</em>; Enoch, <em>Domestic Occupations</em>.</span><div>[82]</div></sup> For the SLHP, the ethos was tied to the degree to which the writer understood the interviewee and their positionality, including their community. Harris’ credibility then emerges from her positionality as a woman able to be a sympathetic listener among her own community.</p> <p>What is not said here, what is visibly invisible, is the way her whiteness is simultaneously used to give her the permission and ability to move freely among her town, as well as across the state of North Carolina, to acquire interviews from both Black and White residents. In total, Harris wrote interviews with 95 people, of which 27 were from White women, 36 were from White men, 18 were from Black women, and 12 were from Black men.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Two interviews were with Women whose race was not recorded.</span><div>[83]</div></sup> Black writers were not afforded this same freedom of movement and access to different racialized communities as consequences for crossing into segregated White-only spaces had violent and potentially lethal results. Therefore, it was the interrelation of Harris’ whiteness, gender, as well as her middle-class connections that positioned her as a sympathetic listener, which, together with her writing skills, led her to acquire more interviews than any other writer in the SLHP.</p> <p>In addition to gendered ideas about women as more sympathetic listeners, White women were also positioned as less threatening and thus more likely to gain entrance into communities thought to be resistant to interviews. Ida Moore’s early work on interviews with mill workers demonstrated how she used this assumption to her advantage. Couch hired Ida Moore in May 1938 as one of the first people to work on the life histories project in the position of a non-certified, non-security worker. In a letter advocating for her hire, he wrote, "we have in hand at present in typescript a novel of hers which has been read by about one-half dozen persons, all of whom have recommended it highly...Miss Moore has had two years of college work, has taught school, and has learned much in the last ten years from having to forage for a living for herself and several brothers and sisters. Of the persons whom I know, who are available for this job, I consider her the best."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(138)}><span>Letter to Edwin Bjorkman from W.T.

Together with these specifically stated skills, Couch used Moore’s gender, race, and class to task her with what he and others thought would be some of the most difficult communities to interview, those from the industrial mills that were spreading across North Carolina. These mills were known for harsh working conditions and overbearing managerial systems that frowned upon outsiders asking questions. According to Couch, many argued that "‘the effort to get stories from people living in textile mill villages would arouse suspicion and that any person attempting to get material would very likely be rejected. It was also said that the people would not talk.’"<sup className="tooltip"><span>As quoted in Hirsch, <em>Portrait of America</em>, 167.</span><div>[85]</div></sup> However, Moore "proved the job could be done" by collecting more than 28 life histories from mill workers.</p> <p>Contrary to any difficulty, Moore describes the ease with which she enters towns, homes, and lives in the life histories she wrote. She is welcomed into living rooms, invited to share meals with families who don’t have much food and asked to sit in chairs that are positioned within a few feet of people’s beds in their one-room homes.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Life History of Frank Martin written by Ida Moore, October 31, 1938, Folder 680 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Life History of unknown written by Ida Moore, October 31, 1938, Folder 651 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; Life History of Ellie Westbrooks written by Ida Moore, October 31, 1938, Folder 664 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://dc.lib.unc.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/03709/id/593/rec/">[link]</a></span><div>[86]</div></sup> Moore is afforded access to these intimate spaces of the home in large part because of her gender and race.

In fact, the way in which she gained entrance to the Martin home in order to reveal a poignant story was so important that it was used to create a radio documentary. One interviewee describes Moore to her husband, encouraging him to talk to Moore. Here is "writer-lady I tole I had the conversation with las week. She is writing up people in this county so’s the rest of the world can know how we lives.

Within the intimacy of the home, the dominion of women, Moore used her gender and the unmarked-ability of her whiteness to position herself as a professional writer knowledgeable about the struggles of home life to put interviewees at ease and encourage them to share their life histories to someone who was otherwise a stranger.<sup className="tooltip"><span>While Muncy writes about the professionalization of social work, the same is true here, in which White women establish their professionalization by focusing on their expertise in the home. <em>Creating a Female Dominion in American Reform</em>, 1890-1935</span><div>[89]</div></sup> Leaning into such gendered and raced assumptions to establish a professional ethos was the same rhetorical move that White women performed to position themselves as experts in the growing field of social work. Moore did such a good job showing that life histories could be collected from what was considered one of the hardest to reach communities that she wrote the manual on life histories, which was sent to all writers and administrators in the SLHP.</p> <p>While Couch and other SLHP administrators in North Carolina looked to White women as lead writers who could savvily use their positionality to gain access to communities to write compelling life histories, their assumptions were not shared throughout the SLHP. Other key state administrators relied on problematic ideas of women as less capable than men rather. Most notably, James Aswell and William McDaniel in Tennessee took a significantly different approach to their writers as they felt virtually none of them were capable of writing. Complaining of the incompetence of the writers, Aswell wrote Couch,</p> <blockquote> <p>"We are handicapped by having no field workers who can write or know what to look for. I have to tear down each thing that comes in, reassemble it, and then send it back with detailed instructions for expansion...When the piece is returned (with blanks that we furnish filled out with physical description of the interviewed and the neighborhood), then the thing has to be cut, the dialogue made natural and often more material sent for to fill up the cracks in the continuity...The field workers themselves are often half-illiterates. While this has its obvious advantages, the disadvantages are also pretty heavy."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Letter to J.R Aswell from W.T. Couch, January 9, 1939, Folder 1113 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</span><div>[90]</div></sup></p> </blockquote> <p>Despite the extremely condescending tone and opaque meaning of why it would be advantageous to have half-illiterates as field workers, Aswell and McDaniel did see some promise in three White female writers, Nellie Gray Toler, Della Yoe, Ruth Clark, who ultimately were the three most prolific writers in Tennessee. However, the promise that was seen was mostly in the women’s ability to connect with the community and record information rather than their writing which they admonished with such elite and sexist critique.</p> <p>Writing about Nellie Gray Toler, Aswell explained, "we’ve had a special problem in getting out these life histories. Some of the ‘writers’ could not write. Take Toler, for example. Her sole virtue is facility with shorthand. Most of her papers come to us in such a jumbled mess that at first reading, nobody on earth could make head nor tail of them. It is only after the most painstaking delving and cutting that sense begins to emerge."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(139)}><span>Letter to Walter Cutter from J.R Aswell, May 6, 1939, Folder 1136 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[91]</div></sup> While with less malevolence, McDaniel made a similar backhanded compliment of Toler in a letter to Couch about the process of life history collection in Tennessee, "though she is no writer, she is no doubt our most valuable field worker. She is able and willing to do efficiently anything we ask."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(140)}><span>Letter to Couch from McDaniel, June 20, 1939, Folder 1143 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[92]</div></sup> In the same letter, he gives "praise" to Ruth Clark, explaining that her "greatest attribute is that she is one of the people. She shares their views, religion and mode of living, and through that gets into her stories the essence of their community life."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[93]</div></sup></p> <p>In both of these examples, Aswell and McDaniel downplay, if not outrightly denigrate, the writing abilities of Toler and Clark, instead of positioning their usefulness as a matter of their willingness to record as well as connect to the communities that they were interviewing. Such painfully gendered notions of professional writing likely resulted from similar rhetorical moves made within the field of social work as well as the growing equation of clerical work with women’s work. This view saw clerical work as the "routinized and deskilled" recording of material that was already intellectually composed, leading to the understanding that the act of "writing," as Solberg explains, was split into the "head" work of male executives and the "hand" work of female clerical workers."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Solberg, "Taking Shorthand for Literacy," 3.</span><div>[94]</div></sup> This formulation of writing devalues the "bodily labor of writing" and the expertise needed to navigate complex social environments to acquire interviewees and choose relevant information to document.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Ibid.</span><div>[95]</div></sup> It flattens the writing process to the final end product, erasing its composite parts and the labor performed by the White female writers.</p> <p>Though Couch took a different approach to administer life histories than McDaniel, Aswell, and other SLHP supervisors, White women played a central role in the SLHP. Women occupied these roles because of the gendered assumptions about their supposed superior abilities to listen and their demur position, which then allowed them to put interviewees at ease. Certain writers even used those assumptions to create space for their writing and approach to life histories, such as Bernice Harris and Muriel Wolff, two of the most prolific writers.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(183)}><span>Bernice Harris, <em>Southern Savory</em> (University of North Carolina Press, 1964).

In fact, Black writers were systematically excluded from the project, even as efforts were still made to capture the life histories of Black interviewees. However, the ways in which blackness was represented often corresponded to Jim Crow characterizations expected by a White audience, which <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(5)}>Layer 4</span> demonstrates.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="The Marginalization of Black Writers" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>Looking at the maps of Black writers <ChangeMapLink value="geo_black_writers">[map]</ChangeMapLink> and White writers <ChangeMapLink value="geo_white_writers">[map]</ChangeMapLink> reveals that White writers wrote the vast majority of life histories.

McKinney was a graduate of Xavier University of New Orleans, and collected the stories of residents of the crescent city. As a member of an integrated unit, McKinney and his colleagues within the Louisiana FWP demonstrated that hiring and creating the institutional structures that included as wide a range of perspectives as possible. The data and work in Louisiana bring into relief racist ideologies that guided the life histories project in the other Southern states, despite advocacy from colleagues within the FWP.</p> <p>To increase Black representation in the ranks of the FWP, in 1936 Alsberg created the Office of Negro Affairs led by Sterling Brown and state and local offices known as Negro Working Units.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Stewart, <em>Long Past Slavery</em>, 7-8.</span><div>[98]</div></sup> Yet these units were segregated and often required workers to depend on Historical Black Colleges to find office space as they were forbidden to work in the same space as White colleagues.

These administrators argued that they were unable to hire Black writers because of the requirements of segregation, the lack of writing skill, and the unwillingness of the Washington office to provide adequate resources for hiring.</p> <p>Couch and the other SLHP administrators relied on structures of segregation, together with racialized rhetoric defining writing skill and objectivity to veil their racist hiring practices. When asked to explain why more Black writers had not been hired, Bjorkman wrote to the office of Negro Affairs that not a single Black person had been hired in North Carolina because "the resources of the Writers’ Project ‘have not permitted the setting up of separate establishments, which would be required for such employment.’"<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(141)}><span>"Report on the Status of the Negro in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Tennessee," October 19, 1938, Folder 1096 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[100]</div></sup> Again relying on the argument of scarcity in resources that also effectively blamed Black writers, in a separate letter referencing his inability to hire Black writers, Bjorkman stated,</p> <blockquote> <p>Efforts to do better in this respect have failed on account of the impossibility of finding members of that race capable of qualification for the project while certified on relief. The few employed have invariably had to be dropped after a short time because they did nothing at all...With a very small percentage of non-relief workers allowed to the project, and with such positions absolutely needed for the filling of directive and supervisory positions, it has been impossible to place any negroes in this class.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(142)}><span>Letter to W.T.

Those who were skilled writers did not qualify for relief, and the respective state offices were not willing to expend limited resources on hiring non-relief Black writers.</p> <p>Couch echoed the argument of the inability to find Black writers but did so by appealing to the rhetoric of colorblindness. Writing to Alsberg, he explained,</p> <blockquote> <p>Since taking on the job of Regional Director, I have found it necessary to spend a large part of my time working on the problem of improving the quality of personnel on state staff. I have not recommended or approved anyone for any non-relief position without first having definite evidence in the form of printed manuscript material as to his ability to write. I have held to this in dealing with white persons and I do not believe I should discriminate for or against Negros in this particular. There are no non-relief vacancies in North Carolina or on the Regional staff at the present time. On the Regional staff I have employed only those persons that I think have exceptional talent. Nothing would delight me more than to discover a Negro with exceptional writing talent, legally resident in the states with which I deal, and desiring to work on the Writers’ Project...I shall appreciate greatly any evidence that anyone can give me in locating Negros who are qualified for work on the Writers’ Project in this region.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(144)}><span>Letter to Henry Alsberg from W.

In this case, he relied on racist structures of evidence that purport a type of objectivity and colorblindness to conclude that no Black writers could provide "evidence in the form of printed manuscript material" of "exceptional talent." Such reliance on printed manuscripts did not take into account inequalities in access to presses or higher education, not to mention his opaque definition of what constituted "exceptional talent."</p> <p>Moreover, while Couch seemed to lament the fact that no one was helping him locate qualified Black writers, Irma Neal Henry, Consultant on Negro Affairs in North Carolina, was continually writing him with names and resumes of candidates with a college education and considerable writing experience.<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(145)}><span>Letter to W.T.

Despite the exceptional qualifications of Farrison, Couch claimed that while there were a number of jobs in which Farrison could "be very useful," he did "not see any chance to increase the salaried staff." In other words, there were no paid positions available for Farrison; however, Couch alluded to the fact that there may be a non-paid position available as he had worked with others who offered their assistance "on a voluntary, non-salary basis."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(146)}><span>Letter to Edward Farrison from W.T. Couch, January 31, 1939, Folder 1119 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[106]</div></sup> Therefore, even when Couch was presented with an extremely qualified Black candidate, he was not willing to make a non-relief position available but would consider using his unpaid labor something most could not afford to give, not to mention the insult provided by such a suggestion.</p> <p>When one of the few Black writers were assigned life histories, they were always given African Americans to interview, and their work was continually critiqued as lacking objectivity. In a letter to Couch, Georgia FWP State Director Samuel Tupper wrote, "We have found it very difficult to get good stories written by Negroes about Negroes. The difficulty seems to me that educated Negroes wish to make themselves and their race appear to have a good advantage and they think this can be done by talking in stilted language about things of no interest or importance."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(147)}><span>Letter to Samuel Tupper from W.T. Couch, July 19, 1939, Folder 1146 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[107]</div></sup> Couch seized on this criticism by Tupper that Black writers could not write objectively by immediately writing one of his favorite state directors, William McDaniel, asking him to give "a detailed account of your experience with the Negro writers of life histories" and "any general criticisms of the stories submitted by these writers I wish you would please state what these criticisms were and what efforts you made to have them corrected."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(148)}><span>Letter to McDaniel from W.T. Couch, July 21, 1939, Folder 1146 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[108]</div></sup> Couch’s intention was to compare McDaniel’s response with those from other state directors. The quickness and intensity with which Couch responded to criticism of one writer demonstrated how racialized thinking informed all writing produced by Black writers. Suddenly, all Black writers were clumped together, losing all individuality, such that all of their writing was seen through a lens of blackness that was equated with a lack of skill and objectivity.</p> <p>Such thinking was endemic to the nearly all-white administration of the FWP. FWP staff often questioned whether Black employees of the FWP together with Black informants could be objective, citing their "Negro bias".<sup className="tooltip"><span>Stewart, <em>Long Past Slavery</em>, 134.</span><div>[109]</div></sup> Uncritical of the racist logic that undergirded their critique, these White staff members understood themselves as capable of objectivity, again allowing for whiteness to be synonymous with neutrality.<sup className="tooltip"><span>Stewart, <em>Long Past Slavery,</em> 139.</span><div>[110]</div></sup> Such an assumption that Black writers could not allow Black interviewees to ’speak for themselves was representative of criticism faced by almost all Black writers at the time. Citing Bill Andrews, Stewart explained that "African American autobiography emerged as a genre that relied heavily on rhetorical strategies in order to prove that the black narrator was a purveyor of truth—a truth-teller."<sup className="tooltip"><span>Stewart, <em>Long Past Slavery,</em> 142.</span><div>[111]</div></sup> As the SLHP practiced this racialized thinking that questioned the objectivity of Black writers and interviewees while seeking authentic and real stories demonstrated how neutrality was always already equated with whiteness within the project.</p> <p>In the end, Couch declared, "In the past two months I have spent several hours writing letters and having conferences over the matter of Negro employment on the North Carolina staff and the Regional staff. I feel that this time has been wasted......I do not feel that it is wise for me to spend time getting information about the qualifications of persons that might be employed unless there is a definite prospect of vacancies in which they might be used."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(149)}><span>Letter to Henry Alsberg from W.T. Couch, February 25, 1939, Folder 1124 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[112]</div></sup> While Couch seemed to blame the Washington office for lack of vacancies, it was clear that he was rarely willing to advocate for Black writers to occupy such non-relief positions. Moreover, Couch’s argument about wasting his time was quite poignant given the fact that at the same time he was writing this, he was also berating the state directors for not "looking around" the community for writers who qualify for relief and approaching their personnel with the necessary "enthusiasm and understanding" necessary to discover the "the abilities of persons on their staffs."<sup className="tooltip" onMouseOver={() => props.handleImage(150)}><span>"Memorandum: Work on Life Histories" from W.T. Couch, no date, Folder 1165 in the Federal Writers’ Project papers #3709, Southern Historical Collection, The Wilson Library, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. </span><div>[113]</div></sup> Such a contradiction evidences the underlying racialized logic about which writers were worthy of the time necessary to help them discover their own abilities and allot non-relief positions to those with exceptional talent. This logic aimed to position White writers as more qualified to document and write life histories while disqualifying Black writers from working on the project.</p> </Collapsible> <Collapsible trigger="A Complex Ecosystem" overflowWhenOpen="visible"> <p>Within the complex documentary ecosystem of the FWP, Couch and his fellow administrators carved out a space for the SLHP by creating a version of the life history method that was distinct from other sociological approaches. For the SLHP, life histories were written for a generalized audience by writers who were not trained academics. Most importantly, the FWP life history did not focus on exceptional but rather common workers throughout the South. The interviewees were supposed to give their own perspectives of their lives. The democratic ethos of the project resonated well with the larger FWP concerned with documenting real life as Americans lived it.</p> <p>However, how the SLHP distinguished life histories from its rival projects in the FWP – the Social-ethnic studies, the Folklore project, and the Ex-slave Narratives – alongside competing methods from the world of sociology shaped who could be represented and who could do the work of documenting. They focused on the "typical" person, rather than ethnic communities, and their lived experiences in the present, rather than folklore or the past. Concerns about the region’s economic conditions resulted in a focus on labor. Shaped by Jim Crow logic, the common workers were grouped along a Black/White binary. As a result, other ethnic and indigenous communities were seen as outside the scope of the SLHP. This Black-White binary was also reproduced when the SLHP hired writers. Assumptions about White women’s natural abilities alongside their role in society created space for White women to take control of the pen and typewriter. As <span onClick={() => props.handlePage(5)}>Layer 4</span> discusses, the project’s purpose and the positionality of the writers necessarily shaped the content and form of the life histories.</p> </Collapsible> </div>
